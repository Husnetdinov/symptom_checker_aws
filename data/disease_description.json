{"desc":{"0":"Sinusitis is the inflammation or infection of the sinuses. The sinuses are cavities in the facial portion of the skull, and lined by mucosa. Sinusitis is the inflammation or infection of these sinuses. It develops most frequently in the maxillary sinuses (under the eyes) and the ethmoid sinuses. In more serious infections the infection can involve the bone (osteomyelitis). ","1":"An irritation of the ulnar nerve in the arm. The nerve travels along the inside of the elbow under a bump called the medial epicondyle. Stimulation of this nerve is what causes the arm and hand to tingle when the elbow is struck. This is why this part of the elbow is sometimes called the \"funny bone\". The ulnar nerve in the elbow can become compressed from swelling, arthritis, old fractures or overuse.","10":"The thoracic outlet is the region where neurovascular structures exit the chest. It is composed of the first rib, the subclavian artery and vein, the brachial plexus and the upper part of the lung. Enlargement or movement in these structures can cause compression of the nerve or blood vessels. Occasionally patients will have an extra rib that causes the syndrome. This compression causes the symptoms experienced in the neck and arm. It occurs more often in women between ages 35 and 55.","100":"This disorder describes a collection of symptoms that result from diseases of the cerebellum. The cerebellum is located at the base of the skull and controls coordination, balance, and equilibrium. ","1000":"Common skin condition in which a protein in the skin called keratin forms hard plugs within hair follicles. It causes rough patches and bumps on the skin that can be mistaken for acne. The areas of the body most commonly affected are the arms and legs. The skin takes on a sand paper appearance. The disorder is not serious but can be difficult to treat.","1001":"Dupuytren's contracture is a soft tissue condition that causes a slowly progressive deformity of the hand. The cause is unknown, but is thought to be an inherited disorder and is seen more frequently with increasing age. The condition is more common in men than in women and in people of Northern European heritage. Thick tissue forms under the skin and impedes the movement of the tendons in the hand. This causes the hand to flex and contract causing decreased function of the affected hand. Over time, the fingers bend towards the palm and cannot be straightened. The ring and little finger are most commonly affected while the index finger and thumb are usually spared.","1002":"A loss of a pregnancy before the 20th week of pregnancy. But most happen before the pregnancy is 12 weeks along. Miscarriage occurs commonly. About 15% to 20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage. The most common reason is failure of a fertilized egg to progress to an embryo or genetic changes that occur early on in the fetus. A common sign of miscarriage is vaginal bleeding, but many pregnancies with bleeding do not end in miscarriage. ","1003":"Epiploic appendages are small protrusions from the large intestine. They are usually filled with fat and do not cause any symptoms. Occasionally these appendages lose their blood supply because of a twisting (torsion) or a blood clot (thrombus). The appendage becomes swollen and this disorder is called epiploic appendagitis. The swelling causes the symptoms experienced. No treatment is needed since the disorder resolves on its own. Occasionally this disorder can be mistaken for appendicitis or diverticulitis. ","1004":"Pneumoconiosis is a disease of the lungs caused by the breathing in of tiny particles. A variety of particles such as asbestos, silicon, talc, coal and iron can cause the disease. Over time, the inflammation caused by these particles produces fibrous material in the lungs and results in scarring. This process makes it difficult to breath. The risk of developing pneumoconiosis is related to exposure to the damaging particles. Therefore, occupations such as miners, foundry workers and welders are at a greater risk.","1005":"Swelling of the abdomen is usually from a build-up of fluid (ascites) or from excess air in the intestines.","1006":"An uncommon sleep disorder characterized by episodes of falling asleep at any time and with little warning. These can occur during a conversation or while performing a task such as driving. Typically the episodes are preceded by a period of drowsiness, but the sleep cannot be prevented. Patients experience a disruption of the normal patterns of Rapid Eye Movement (REM), Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep and wakefulness. The disorder is most likely related to a deficiency of brain hypocretin (orexin). Narcolepsy is usually an inherited condition.","1007":"When saliva flow is reduced or stopped, bacteria can grow in a salivary gland. This can cause an infection called sialadenitis. It occurs most often in people over the age of 50 who have a debilitating illness and dry mouth (xerostomia). However, it can happen in any age group, including infants. A stone (sialolith) or kink also can reduce flow through one of the tubes that carry saliva.","1008":"Characterized by poor absorption of nutrients, vitamins and minerals from the intestinal tract into the bloodstream. Many diseases cause malabsorption, such as celiac disease, certain medications, certain types of cancer, certain types of surgery, chronic liver disease, chronic pancreatitis, Crohn's disease, and persistent parasite infections. ","1009":"An inherited disease that results in an abnormal accumulation of copper in the liver, brain and other organs. If left untreated the disorder can lead to liver failure (cirrhosis) and death. \r\n\r\nCopper is ingested in the foods that are eaten. Normally it is absorbed and processed in the liver and excreted in the bile back into the intestines. In the blood, copper is attached to another molecule, ceruloplasmin. In Wilson's disease, blood levels of ceruloplasmin are low, due to a genetic mutation. The result is copper begins accumulating in the liver causing liver failure. If the level continues to increase it overflows into the bloodstream causing damage to other body parts.","101":"A chronic bacterial infection that occurs in the area between overlapping skin (skin folds). It is caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum. The lesions occur in moist areas such as the groin, armpit, and skin folds, and may be itchy. The disorder is more common in people who are obese or diabetic, and in warm climates.","1010":"A contagious viral illness caused by herpes simplex type 1 virus (HSV). In young children it may be their first exposure to the herpes virus resulting in a systemic illness with high fever, blisters, ulcers in the mouth, and inflammation of the gums. Adults may have recurrences manifest only as a \"cold sore\". The sore may resolve even though the HSV virus may remain dormant within the nerve cells. The sores of HSV may return when a person is experiencing emotional or physical stress or immune suppression.  However, attacks of herpes may recur for no identifiable reason.","1011":"Benzodiazepines (Valium, Xanax, Ativan) are tranquilizers and are commonly prescribed for anxiety, panic attacks, and as muscle relaxants. An overdose can cause coma, severe respiratory depression and death. The symptoms of intoxication are accentuated by the co-ingestion of narcotic pain medications and\/or alcohol.","1012":"Disease in one or more of the four valves of the heart: mitral, aortic, tricuspid and pulmonic. These valves separate the small chambers (atria) from the large chambers (ventricles). They open and close allowing blood to flow in only one direction. When they malfunction they can slow the normal flow of blood (stenosis) or can allow the blood to flow in the wrong direction (regurgitation). If the valve is very damaged, both stenosis and regurgitation can occur. If the valve defect is severe, the heart cannot pump blood normally resulting in heart failure. The following conditions can cause valvular heart disease: atherosclerosis, heart attacks, infection, congenital disorders, rheumatic fever, autoimmune diseases, collagen vascular disorders, and trauma. ","1013":"Pain in an area of the body where a previous episode of shingles occurred. Shingles is a reactivation of the chicken pox virus later in life after the original chicken pox infection has resolved. In most people the pain of shingles goes away after a few weeks. In some patients the rash of shingles resolves but the pain persists and this is called post herpetic neuralgia. (The chicken pox virus is a kind of herpes virus, related to the virus that causes herpes lesions of the mouth and genitals: hence the name \"post-herpetic\"). This complication of shingles is more common in those patients over 60. At times the pain can be severe.","1014":"A contagious, sexually-transmitted infection caused by the bacteria, Treponema pallidum. The disorder occurs in three stages with each stage more severe. The first stage, primary syphilis, causes a painless sore that is usually in the genital area. The second stage (\"secondary syphilis\") causes fever, rash, and joint pain. Advanced syphilis (\"tertiary syphilis\") causes brain or heart or blood vessel injury and can result in irreversible damage. ","1015":"A disease characterized by tiny clumps of inflammatory cells in different areas of the body. These clumps of inflammation are called granulomas. The sarcoid granulomas can affect any part of the body with the most common being the lungs, lymph nodes, eyes and skin. The cause of the disorder is not known. Women, black Americans, and having close relatives who suffer from sarcoidosis increase the chance of acquiring the disease. Many patients do not have any symptoms; and the disease is discovered after they obtain a chest x-ray for an unrelated reason.","1016":"Infection in the lung. The air cells can fill with fluid (pus) causing shortness of breath and breathing problems. Pneumonia can be severe and is a common cause of death. Certain risk factors, such as smoking, excessive alcohol use, diabetes, depressed immune systems, and poor nutrition increase the risk of developing pneumonia. Vaccination with PCV13 (Prevnar) and PPSV23 (Pneumovax) help protect against the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia.","1017":"An itchy rash that is caused by fluid entering the skin after a localized release of histamine. An allergic reaction is the most common cause. Occasionally they are chronic and recurrent with no known inciting event. They occur singly and in groups and can affect the lips, eyes and other mucous membranes of the body as well as the skin.","1018":"The pituitary gland is located below the brain, just behind the bridge of the nose. The pituitary gland controls the production of many hormones and a tumor in this area can cause alterations in these hormones. The optic nerve passes next to this gland in the brain, and tumors of the pituitary can affect vision by pressing on this nerve.","1019":"The subarachnoid space covers the brain and spinal cord. A subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) occurs when there is bleeding into this space. A subarachnoid hemorrhage can be life threatening. The most common cause of bleeding is a rupture of an aneurysm. An aneurysm is a focal area of swelling of an artery in the brain. An aneurysm can be congenital (present from time of birth) and may not cause any symptoms unless it bleeds. A tendency to form aneurysms can be an inherited trait. Other causes of SAH include head trauma and arteriovenous malformation (AVM, a tangle of veins and arteries that is a variation of normal anatomy and is prone to rupture). ","102":"Phencyclidine, or PCP, is an illegal street drug that can cause hallucinations, agitation, seizures and death. This drug is available in many forms (tablet, liquid, powder) and can be taken by mouth or smoked. PCP is very addictive.                                        ","1020":"Pieces of fat from the bone marrow enter the blood vessels of the body. This may block the flow of blood through the blood vessel or travel through the heart and lodge in the lungs. This disorder can occur during or after surgery or after a traumatic injury. A common scenario is when fat enters a vein after a fracture to a large bone, such as the femur or pelvis, or after surgery on these bones. Fat emboli are usually widespread and cause symptoms 1-3 days after the injury or event. This disease is serious with 10%-20% of patients not surviving the event.","1021":"An abnormal widening or ballooning of an artery in the brain. Most are congenital and do not cause symptoms until they leak blood or burst and bleed profusely. Rarely the dilation of the vessel can be large enough to cause symptoms before they leak by pressing on surrounding brain. The most common initial symptom of bleeding from a brain aneurysm is a sudden severe headache.","1022":"An over production of parathyroid hormone resulting in high calcium levels in the blood. There are four parathyroid glands located in the neck next to the thyroid gland. There are two types of hyperparathyroidism, primary and secondary. In primary one of the glands produces too much parathyroid hormone usually from a non-cancerous growth of the gland called an adenoma or from a cancer of the gland. Secondary occurs when another disease process causes low levels of calcium resulting in elevated levels of parathyroid hormone. The most common causes of secondary disease are failure of the intestines to absorb calcium, vitamin D deficiency or kidney failure. The elevated calcium levels can result in osteoporosis, kidney stones, hypertension, pancreatitis, peptic ulcers, and heart disease.","1023":"Microscopic larvae (very young forms) of jelly fish that become trapped between the skin and the bathing suit. These larvae have the same stinging nematocysts as the adults, resulting in the skin irritation and pain. Sea lice are common in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, and along both the east and west coasts of the United States during the summer months.","1024":"The aortic valve separates the left ventricle and the aorta. When the valve opens, it allows blood to flow from the left ventricle to the aorta. When it closes, the valve prevents blood from flowing backward. In aortic regurgitation the valve does not close normally. As a result, blood flows backward from the aorta into the left ventricle. This back flow forces the heart to work much harder, and can result in an abnormal enlargement of the heart (cardiomyopathy) and heart failure. The most common causes are degeneration of the valve with age, infection (endocarditis), congenital abnormality, and rheumatic fever.","1025":"A stab wound to the face. These wounds can damage structures deep to the skin such as the sinus, bone, or brain. The object that caused the wound can carry bacteria or foreign material deep into the wound and cause infections. Puncture wounds from animal or human bites are especially prone to infections. Facial infections can be severe causing nerve damage and extension of the infection into the brain.","1026":"A rare disorder that causes muscle weakness and pain. The cause is felt to be an autoimmune disease, which means the patient's immune system becomes over active and attacks the muscles causing inflammation of the muscle fibers. The muscles of the upper legs often are affected first causing problems climbing stairs and getting out of a chair. This disease can be very serious, causing breathing problems, abnormal beating of the heart, heart failure, and difficulty swallowing. Polymyositis usually affects people between the ages of 30 and 60, and some patients can have other autoimmune diseases such as lupus. ","1027":"An infection of the intestinal tract that results from the parasite, Giardia lamblia. Giardiasis is spread through ingestion of contaminated food or water, or through contact with contaminated feces. Transmission through contaminated water is most common, and is frequent among people traveling in areas with poor sanitation or drinking directly from streams, especially in mountainous Western states. ","1028":"Pressure and compression of the nerves in the lower part of the spinal canal (lumbar region). It is a surgical emergency and if untreated can lead to paralysis of the legs and inability to control the bowel and bladder. Causes include trauma, herniated disc, spinal stenosis, cancer, bleeding, or inflammation.","1029":"Uterine cancer is the abnormal growth of cells in the uterus. These abnormal cells ultimately grow and produce a tumor. There are two types of uterine cancer. The first type involves the lining of the uterus (endometrial carcinoma) and the second type involves the musculature wall of the uterus (uterine sarcoma). Uterine cancer is the most common cancer of the female reproductive system and endometrial carcinoma is the most common cause of uterine cancer. The cancer occurs most commonly in middle-aged to elderly women.","103":"Meconium is the first stool of the newborn, and is green in color. Meconium aspiration occurs when the newborn breathes in this green material at the time of delivery resulting in damage to the lungs and breathing difficulties. Not all babies who breathe in meconium suffer lung damage. The following conditions increase the likelihood of this disorder: pregnancy beyond 40 weeks gestation, decreased oxygen to the baby during delivery, a difficult delivery, mothers with high blood pressure, and mothers with diabetes.","1030":"A general term referring to any disease of muscles. Myopathies can be acquired or inherited, and can occur at birth or later in life. There are many inherited types including: muscular dystrophies, glycogen storage diseases, and congenital myopathies. Other myopathies include those caused by drugs (especially statins), alcohol, or toxins; some endocrine gland disorders, and the inflammatory myopathies, such as dermatomyositis and polymyositis.","1031":"A disorder in which a person takes excessive amounts of laxatives. Laxatives are medications that help a person with constipation have a bowel movement. These medications can be abused and are usually taken to lose weight. Serious blood chemistry abnormalities may occur. The bowel can also stop contracting on its own requiring the use of laxatives to function normally; this is sometimes called a \"lazy colon\" or \"intestinal paralysis.\"","1032":"A condition characterized by an inadequate blood supply to the leg or arm. The cells of the limb begin to die releasing material into the surrounding soft tissue producing swelling, and pain. There are many causes with the most common being atherosclerotic disease resulting in narrowing of the blood vessels. Other causes include: trauma, infections, and an embolus (blood clot).","1033":"Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV-type 1 commonly causes mouth or lip sores that resemble fever blisters (oral herpes). HSV-type 2 typically affects the genital area (genital herpes). The HSV virus cannot be removed from the body once infected but may cause no symptoms for prolonged periods (it may remain dormant). When dormant, the virus typically lives within the nerve cells. The sores of HSV may return when a person is experiencing emotional or physical stress or immune suppression.  However, attacks of herpes may recur for no identifiable reason.","1034":"Cancer of the maxillary sinus. The maxillary sinuses are located in the cheek area of the face. Although it is a rare cancer, the maxillary sinus is the most common location for this tumor. There are usually no symptoms until the cancer extends through the wall. The tumors can be large and involve surrounding facial structures when they finally cause symptoms making them hard to remove and treat.","1035":"PMS is experienced during the week or two weeks prior to a menstrual period, and involves behavioral symptoms and possibly physical symptoms. The symptoms usually stop soon after menstruation begins. Half of all women experience PMS at some time, and the peak occurrence is between ages 25 and 40. ","1036":"Arm swelling can result from several causes, such as inflammation, infection, a blood clot in a vein (deep vein thrombosis), or allergic reaction. The inflammation can occur in a joint or in the soft tissue beneath the skin. Blocked lymph channels can also cause arm swelling (lymphedema).","1037":"Disorder in which the pressure within the eye is increased. It most commonly results from abnormal circulation or blocked drainage of the fluid (aqueous humor) within the eye.  The cause for this is often unknown though it can run in families or follow an infection or injury, especially if there is bleeding in the eye. Normally, the fluid produced is absorbed at the same rate. When this balance is upset, pressure may build up in the eye. If the abnormally high pressure is not reduced damage to the nerve of the eye (optic nerve) can occur resulting in the loss of sight. Pre-Glaucoma is suspected with increased intraocular pressure, with no perceived damage to the disc (the nerve-containing structure at the back of the eye) or visual fields.","1038":"A friction blister is an area of skin that is raised and filled with clear liquid. They occur in areas where the skin has been rubbed aggressively (often the feet or hands). Minor damage to the skin underneath results in the accumulation of clear fluid and, if blood vessels are involved, bloody fluid. These blisters are called blood blisters.","1039":"Impetigo is a common skin infection. It is highly contagious and usually affects infants and children. The crusty lesions are typically found around the mouth and on the face. The infecting bacteria are mostly of the streptococcal or staphylococcal species. These bacteria can enter normal skin, but more often invade skin affected by cuts, insect bites, or a pre-existing rash. The disorder may resolve on its own. But treatment with topical or oral antibiotics reduces the complication rate.","104":"A disorder of the inner ear that causes dizziness, a sensation of spinning (vertigo), hearing loss, and ringing in the ear (tinnitus). The fluid-filled semicircular canals (labyrinths) of the inner ear help with balance and enable one to orient themselves in relation to gravity. Inflammation and a fluid build-up in these canals are thought to cause Meniere's disease. The exact cause is unknown. This disorder can occur at any age but is more common between the ages of 40 and 50.","1040":"An abnormal connection between the arteries and veins. Generally these develop before birth. Most cause no symptoms unless they enlarge or bleed. AVMs can occur anywhere in the body. AVMs in the brain can cause headaches and seizures. ","1041":"A virus that infects the intestinal tract causing vomiting and diarrhea. It is the most common cause of severe vomiting and diarrhea in children and kills many children each year in underdeveloped countries. Almost all children have had the infection by their third birthday, so they will usually build immunity against future infection. Children between the ages of 6-24 months are at greatest risk for severe infections.","1042":"A bacterial infection involving the pad of the finger tip that causes swelling and pain. Sometimes the infection can progress into a collection of pus called an abscess. This infection can be caused by small punctures of the finger pad or associated with infections of the nail bed (paronychia). The most common causes of this infection are staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus bacteria. ","1043":"The vertebral artery feeds into the basilar artery. The basilar artery supplies the cerebellum and mid brain. The vertebral arteries travel through a channel in the spine. Sudden movement of the neck, such as in a car accident, can cause injury (dissection) of this vessel. But a specific cause may not be identified. The dissection can cause an obstruction of blood flow resulting in a stroke. Strokes in this area cause balance problems, room spinning, double vision and difficulty speaking.","1044":"A response to stress that results in significant emotional or behavioral symptoms and impairment of function in daily life. The disorder typically causes symptoms of depression, anxiety or both. In severe cases patients may have suicidal thoughts. The symptoms begin within 3 months of a stressful life event.","1045":"A temporary decrease in the blood supply to some part of the brain. The affected part of the brain does not function properly, producing the symptoms observed. The syndrome looks similar to a stroke except the symptoms resolve quickly, usually within an hour. The most common causes of TIA are atherosclerosis and atrial fibrillation. These patients need a prompt work-up to identify and treat the cause of the TIA because of the high risk of stroke, especially within the first week after a TIA.","1046":"Endophthalmitis is a rare, but vision threatening, infection of the deep structures of the eye. Most cases are bacterial but fungal, viral and parasitic infections can occur. Endophthalmitis is a complication of penetrating or blunt eye injury, foreign bodies, an infection spread through the blood or ocular surgery.","1047":"Skin condition that presents with lacy, web-like purplish appearance on the skin of the arms and legs. Most commonly presents by itself without an associated illness, but may be associated with side effects from medication, autoimmune diseases (lupus, anti-phospholipid syndrome) and vascular conditions. It has been known to be more pronounced in colder climates and affect females more than males.","1048":"Severe obesity makes it hard to expand the lungs. Patients are unable to breathe deeply enough to get enough oxygen. It is common for severely obese people to have low oxygen levels (hypoxia) especially at night. The hypoxia can result in heart damage and heart failure.","1049":"Head injuries range from minor trauma to concussions, unconsciousness and death. Traumatic injury to the brain can cause bleeding on the surface of the brain or within the brain. The brain can be permanently damaged by this trauma. Coma occurs when the central portion of the brain is unable to activate or stimulate the rest of the brain to wakefulness or when there is extensive injury to the brain. Head injuries can also produce fractures of the skull. Depressed skull fractures can cause a piece of bone to penetrate or deform the brain. Basilar skull fractures involve the base of the skull. They can injure the nerves that pass through these regions and produce cerebrospinal fluid leaks.","105":"Angiodysplasia is the most common abnormality of small blood vessels in the stomach or intestines. The blood vessel walls balloon out. This makes the walls thinner and weaker, which can lead to breaks and bleeding. Angiodysplasia is a common cause of gastrointestinal bleeding, especially in people over the age of 60.","1050":"Melasma is skin that is darker than the surrounding skin. It usually develops on the face and is related to sunlight exposure. Hormone replacement therapy, birth control pills and pregnancy are associated with melasma. It is much more common in women than men.","1051":"Trauma to the extremity can cause a contusion (bruise), fracture, bleeding, a crush injury, or sprain. Underlying structures such as tendon, nerves, ligaments or blood vessels can also be damaged. A severe crush injury can result in a serious limb threatening injury called compartment syndrome.","1052":"Lemierre's syndrome is a form of blood vessel inflammation (thrombophlebitis) caused, most commonly, by a bacteria called Fusobacterium necrophorum. These bacteria are normally present in the mouth. They usually do not cause an infection unless an abscess (pocket of pus) containing other bacteria such as streptococcus are present. Once Fusobacterium necrophorum multiplies in the abscess, it can then travel from the abscess to the internal jugular vein and cause an infected clot. Pieces of clot can then break off and travel to the lungs (septic emboli) resulting in serious infection and pneumonia. The disease is rare, but does tend to affect young, healthy adults.  ","1053":"This term describes a lifelong pattern of behavior that interferes with normal social interaction and function. There are a variety of named personality disorder types. Examples are \"borderline personality\" and \"antisocial personality.\" Psychiatrists have made lists of very specific criteria that are used to diagnose a person with personality disorder. A personality disorder often results in trouble with relationships, work and the law. Individuals suffering with these conditions feel their behavior is normal and only a few ever seek psychiatric help.","1054":"Amphetamine (Methamphetamine) abuse leads to memory loss, aggression, psychotic behavior, heart damage, malnutrition, and severe dental problems. The chronic user can suffer severe psychological and medical damage. An overdose can cause severe agitation, seizure and death.","1055":"A developmental disorder that usually appears in the first 3 years of life. Some children progress normally until 2 years of age and then begin to show symptoms. The disorder affects the brain's normal development of social and communication skills. There is no known single cause but genetic and environmental factors are thought to contribute to the disease. There is no known evidence that links autism to childhood vaccines. Approximately 1.4% of children in the US are affected. Boys are more than 4 times more likely to have ASD than girls.","1056":"An inflammatory disorder involving severe aching and stiffness in the neck, shoulder and hip areas. The exact cause is unknown. Biopsies of achy muscles are normal when evaluated microscopically. In some people, the disorder is related to temporal arteritis (giant cell arteritis). It rarely occurs before age 50.","1057":"Gingivitis means inflamed gum tissue around the teeth. It is caused by bacteria found in dental plaque. Gingivitis is common. People at high risk for gingivitis include those who don't brush and floss regularly, are pregnant, or have poorly controlled diabetes. Gingivitis is also more common among people who take certain medicines. These medicines include birth control pills, anti-epilepsy drugs and calcium channel blockers.","1058":"The sensation of the room spinning or the person spinning. The symptoms of vertigo typically get worse with head movement, and decrease with the eyes closed. Nausea and vomiting are frequently associated with vertigo. There are many causes of vertigo with the most common being: labyrinthitis, vestibular neuronitis, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, motion sickness syndrome and Meniere's disease. Rarer causes include: vestibular migraines, inner ear trauma, perilymphatic fistula, medication damage to inner ear (ototoxicity), acoustic neuromas and other cerebellopontine angle tumors, vertebral basilar insufficiency, and multiple sclerosis.","1059":"The intentional inhalation of chemical vapors to attain a psychological \"high\" or euphoric effect. A wide variety of substances, including many common household products, are abused by inhalers. This type of drug abuse is commonly called \"huffing\".","106":"An abnormal heart rhythm occurs when the electrical impulses traveling through the heart cause the heart to beat too fast, too slow or irregularly. Often, an arrhythmia is seen on an electrocardiogram (ECG) even when the person has no symptoms. But it can also be very serious, causing the person to pass out or even die. ","1060":"Blood loss can lead to anemia. The most common cause of significant blood loss is bleeding into the intestinal tract.","1061":"A localized inflammation of the skin due to irritation or an allergic reaction after contact with a foreign substance or allergen. Common triggers are plants, cosmetics, detergents, chemicals, medications, solvents, and adhesives.","1062":"Cerebellar ataxia is caused by damage or inflammation to a part of the brain called the cerebellum. The cerebellum is responsible for coordination and balance. Individuals with cerebellar ataxia experience difficulty walking, dizziness and clumsiness. The disease may come on suddenly (acute) or slowly (chronic). There are a variety of causes of cerebellar ataxia including autoimmune disorders, alcohol, inherited disorders, drugs, cancer and infection.","1063":"The liver is in the right upper abdomen partially protected by the ribs. The liver can be injured from blunt trauma such as a motor vehicle accident, fall, or being hit in the abdomen. This organ can also be damaged from a gunshot wound or stabbing. There are multiple different types of injuries ranging from a bruise to complete destruction of the liver. Liver injuries can bleed a great deal and lead to death if not treated immediately. A patient cannot live without a liver so only the damaged parts of the liver that cannot be saved will be removed. The liver can regenerate itself if the bleeding can be stopped. Some liver injuries are caused by a biopsy of the liver, but this is rare.","1064":"Fractures of the elbow are common in children and the supracondylar fracture is the most common type. They occur through the growth plate of the humerus (the upper arm bone connecting the shoulder and elbow). These injuries most often occur after falling on an outstretched arm. The most common age is 5-7 years old. These injuries can have associated injuries to the nerves and the blood vessels, and can swell significantly in the elbow causing an orthopedic emergency termed compartment syndrome.","1065":"Defined as a person almost dying because they were underwater and unable to breathe. The official definition is survival for greater than 24 hours after being rescued. It is estimated 6,000-8,000 people die from drowning every year. The most common causes of near drowning are: poor swimming abilities; impaired mental function due to drinking alcohol or head injuries; attempted suicide; falling through thin ice; and trying to save someone who is drowning. Another common cause is leaving small children unattended around bodies of water. After removal from the water, immediate CPR if the person is not breathing is essential to survival. Up to one third of near drowning patients suffer moderate to severe brain damage.","1066":"Retrobulbar neuritis is an inflammation of the optic nerve behind the eye. This nerve carries information from the eye to the back of the brain. When the nerve is inflamed, the quality of the visual information is affected. Retrobulbar neuritis can be caused by a variety of conditions such as infections (syphilis, meningitis), exposure to chemicals, multiple sclerosis, tumors and allergic reactions. Although, in many cases, the cause is not found. Retrobulbar neuritis most commonly affects females and is a disease of young adulthood (average age of onset is 32).","1067":"An autoimmune disease caused by antibodies made against one's own body. It can be associated with other autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, polymyositis). The disease attacks the lacrimal and salivary glands causing dry eyes and mouth. The syndrome occurs most often in women age 40 - 50.","1068":"Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a condition that affects some women approximately 5 to 10 days prior to their monthly menstrual cycle. Symptoms are similar to premenstrual syndrome (PMS) but are much more severe. They include depressive symptoms, anxiety and irritability in addition to physical symptoms such as breast tenderness, menstrual cramps, bloating and headaches. PMDD affects approximately 3-8% of women during the years that they are menstruating. The cause of PMDD is unknown but is more common in women with underlying depression and anxiety disorders.","1069":"A stab wound to the skin surface. These wounds can damage structures deep to the skin such as blood vessels, nerves, tendons, or any other important structures depending on the area injured. The object that caused the wound can carry bacteria or foreign material deep into the wound and cause infections. Puncture wounds from animal or human bites are especially prone to infections. ","107":"Conditions or diseases caused by an over active immune system attacking the body's own tissues and organs. Prominent examples include celiac disease, diabetes mellitus type 1, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, multiple sclerosis (MS), Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Many different organs can be damaged depending on the specific disease.","1070":"Exposure to environmental heat can cause heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke. Heat stroke can cause heart and brain damage and result in death. The very young, very old, those with chronic illnesses, and the intoxicated are most susceptible.","1071":"The majority of insect bites are harmless causing only local pain and swelling. Occasionally an allergic reaction can occur, and\/or a local skin infection called cellulitis. ","1072":"Atelectasis is collapse of all or part of the lung. Classically atelectasis occurs because there is obstruction to the tubes in a part of the lung.  Atelectasis is common after surgery, prolonged hospital stays and with lung infections.  Often atelectasis is not symptomatic and is typically diagnosed with chest x-ray. The condition is one of the most commonly encountered abnormalities discovered on chest x-rays.   Other causes include foreign bodies, tumor, pleural effusion, trauma, or pneumothorax among other causes.  Often therapeutic therapies are suggested such as chest physiotherapy, which includes forced expiration technique (huffing) to help remove the obstruction (mucus) and expand the lung.  After surgery and during prolonged bedrest, patients are encouraged to take frequent deep breaths and cough to prevent atelectasis.","1073":"The arch between the heel and the foot flattens, causing the entire foot to touch the ground when walking. A patient may be born with flat feet or develop this condition after an injury or with age. Many patients have no symptoms and will not need treatment. Others may have foot pain and require therapy. ","1074":"Bleeding from the nose. The most common cause is trauma from a finger or foreign body, or from drying of the nasal mucosa. Most bleeding is from the front part of the nose along the nasal septum. In this area is a collection of small arteries and veins called Kiesselbach's plexus and irritation of the nasal mucosa in this area can result in significant bleeding. Bleeding from the rear of the nose (posterior epistaxis) is more difficult to control and may require admission to the hospital.","1075":"Dacryostenosis is a blocked tear duct causing increased eye tearing and crusting of the eyelids.  It is most common in babies and usually spontaneously improves after 12 months. However, it may occur at any age, most often as a result of infection or injury. ","1076":"A rare disease caused by 2 extra copies of the short arm of chromosome 12. Rather than a hereditary condition this disorder is felt to be a sporadic event. Patients with this disorder have decreased muscle tone, mental retardation and facial abnormalities. Other names for this disorder are Killian\/Teschler-Nicola syndrome, Pallister Mosaic syndrome, Tetrasomy 12p, Killian syndrome, and Teschler-Nicola\/ Killian syndrome. It is estimated there are about 200 cases of this disorder in the United States.","1077":"Caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis. There are three types: bubonic (lymph nodes), pneumonic (lung), and septicemic (blood). People can get the plague when they are bitten by a flea that carries the plague bacteria from an infected rodent. Certain forms of the plague can be spread from human to human via coughing. The disease is rare in the United States, but is seen in parts of California, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico. ","1078":"Damage to the spinal cord. The most common types of injury are: direct compression from a spine fracture, hematoma, or abscess; lack of blood supply from a blood vessel injury supplying the spinal cord; direct injury from trauma such as a gunshot wound or stabbing; or stretching of the spinal cord during trauma causing a bruise of the spinal cord. The location and severity of the injury determines the nerve deficits experienced. If the injury is high in the neck death can result from inability to breathe. ","1079":"The brain is surrounded by three linings, and the outermost is the dura mater. Head trauma can result in bleeding in the space between the dura and the brain. The bleeding normally occurs from injured veins in the dura. As the bleeding continues it causes pressure on the brain resulting in the symptoms and damage to the brain. Bleeding can be recognized immediately, an acute subdural, or many weeks after the initial injury, a chronic subdural. Symptoms can vary from complete paralysis and coma to mild alterations in behavior. This disorder is most commonly found in adults over age 50. Any disorder that prevents normal blood clotting increases the risk of this disorder.","108":"When a man has trouble getting or keeping an erection. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is also called impotence. Occasional ED is not a cause for concern but when the problem is more consistent it could be a sign of a more serious disease and medical help should be sought. ED has many causes including psychological stress, heart disease, diabetes, previous pelvic surgery, obesity, high blood pressure, certain neurological diseases, hormonal imbalances, tobacco use, alcoholism, and medication side effects. ","1080":"Toe swelling can result from inflammation, infection, allergic reaction or very rarely cancer. Inflammation can be caused by trauma, arthritis, gout, or an autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis.","1081":"Hepatitis B is a viral infection that damages the liver. Most people have a brief period of symptoms and then clear the virus. Others develop chronic (long term) inflammation of the liver. The virus is spread through contact with infected blood, semen, or vaginal fluids. The virus is most commonly spread through sexual contact with an infected person, or through sharing of injection drug equipment (needles). Infected mothers can pass the virus to their child during birth. Individuals at most risk are those workers exposed to blood (healthcare workers) and individuals who practice unprotected sex or share needles. An immunization (vaccine) is available against hepatitis B. ","1082":"Trismus means being unable to open the mouth completely. It is a symptom of another problem, such as muscle, nerve, or joint damage. Trismus can be caused by trauma, tooth grinding or clenching, surgery, radiation, infection, or disease. A problem with the jaw joint is one of the most common causes of trismus. It can develop slowly or suddenly, depending on the cause.","1083":"Inflammation (swelling) of the Achilles tendon that extends from the lower calf to the heel. Pain is located in the back of the ankle and worsens with walking.\r\n","1084":"Diabetic nephropathy means kidney damage caused by diabetes.  High blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) for long periods of time and uncontrolled high blood pressure make it progress more rapidly. The elevated blood sugar and blood pressure cause injury to small blood vessels in the kidneys. As the kidneys become damaged they are unable to remove waste products from the blood. Over time the kidneys can completely fail requiring the patient to need dialysis or a kidney transplant. The likelihood of having this disorder increases with age and with the length of time someone has diabetes. Patients of African, Hispanic, and American Indian descent are more likely to develop diabetic nephropathy. This condition may occur in both Type I and Type II diabetics. Patients with this disorder do not begin having symptoms until a majority of the kidney function is lost. This is why it is important for diabetic patients to have regular checks of their blood sugar and blood pressure and keep them under good control.","1085":"Factor X (ten) deficiency is a rare inherited or acquired deficiency of clotting factor X. This deficiency usually presents with unusual bleeding including recurring nosebleeds, bruising, blood in the urine or excessive bleeding during surgery or trauma. Bleeding may range from mild to severe depending on the extent of the deficiency.  The congenital deficiency is an inherited disorder, leading to a life-long condition.  Later in life factor X deficiency (called acquired factor X deficiency) can develop in people with liver disease, vitamin K deficiency, vitamin K antagonist use, or amyloidosis. Inherited factor X deficiency affects 1 in 500,000 people. ","1086":"Cancer involving the nose and inside the nose. Cancer can be slow or fast growing. Rapidly growing cancers can destroy surrounding normal tissue, and spread to other areas of the body (metastasize). Nasal cancer is rare. It is more likely to occur in men over age 40. Initially there are no or few symptoms. Nasal infection that doesn't heal is a sign that it may be cancer. ","1087":"The physical, mental and emotional reactions resulting from changes and demands in one's life. The reaction can cause a mild to severe depressed mood or be a motivator. Long term stress can cause sleep disorders and lack of energy.","1088":"Non-malignant growths in the nasal cavities. The polyps consist of inflamed nasal mucosa. They are usually inside both sides of the nose. They can grow large and numerous enough to cause nasal distension and obstruction of the airway. They are more common in patients with asthma, hay fever or chronic sinus infections.","1089":"A fracture that occurs when a ligament or tendon attached to a bone pulls away a piece (fragment) of the bone. It can also be associated with serious injury to the ligament or tendon involved.","109":"An abnormal growth of cells in the bone. These tumors can be malignant (cancerous) or benign (slow growing non-cancerous). Cancers that start somewhere else such as the breast or lung and travel to the bone are called metastases and are not considered bone cancers. The most common benign bone tumors are endochondroma, osteochondroma, nonossifying fibroma, chondroblastoma, osteoid osteoma, osteoblastoma, periosteal chondroma, giant cell tumor, and chondromyxoid fibroma. The most common malignant bone cancers are chondrosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and osteosarcoma. It is not known what exactly causes these cancers but the risk is increased in certain families and after exposure to radiation. These tumors can occur in any bone in the body but most often affect the arms and legs. ","1090":"An infection of the testicle. The infection causes swelling and pain in the testicles. The most common cause in adolescents and young adults is mumps, which is a virus. When bacteria are the cause of orchitis, the infection usually spreads from the epididymis which is a gland at the back of the testicle. Gonorrhea or Chlamydia are sexually transmitted infections that can cause epididymo-orchitis. About two thirds of cases involve only one testicle. ","1091":"A change in the blood's pH to an acidic state. Acidosis can be caused by many different disorders including diabetes out of control (diabetic ketoacidosis\/DKA), starvation (especially with alcohol abuse), kidney failure, aspirin overdose, severe infections (sepsis), and severe low blood pressure.","1092":"Occurs when one breathes in smoke from a fire. Smoke is produced during the burning process. What is burning in the fire, the amount of smoke inhaled, and the length of time the smoke is inhaled all contribute to the severity of the injury. Damage is done by the heat of the smoke as well as the toxins in the smoke. Direct injury to the lung can result in failure of the lungs. Additionally the toxins in the smoke can cause life threatening injuries as well. The most common toxin is carbon monoxide.","1093":"An inherited disorder in which patients can have serious adverse reactions to certain anesthetic drugs. The disorder is characterized by a sudden and dangerous elevation of the body temperature usually after receiving anesthetic gas or the paralytic drug succinylcholine. This disorder is autosomal dominant meaning that only one parent needs to have the disease to pass the disorder on to their children. The disease can be very serious causing permanent injury to the kidneys and result in death. ","1094":"Inflammation of the cornea. The cornea is the clear part of the eye that covers the colored portion of the eye. The disorder can be caused by: trauma, ultraviolet radiation (snow blindness, a temporary form of damage to the cornea), welding, infections, inflammatory immune system diseases, and chemical exposures. Wearing sunglasses when outside for long periods of time and wearing an eye shield while welding or working with caustic chemicals can reduce the chance of getting this disorder. ","1095":"Also known as \"interstitial lung disease\". Scarring in the lungs results in thickening of the lung tissue between air sacs. Pulmonary fibrosis is different from emphysema because emphysema causes lung tissue to thin. Pulmonary fibrosis interferes with lung function and causes low oxygen in the blood. Many conditions cause gradual scar formation (fibrosis) in the lungs including: hypersensitivity reactions (a severe type of allergic reaction), sarcoidosis, Wegener's granulomatosis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, infections, environmental agents (asbestos, silica, exposure to certain gases), exposure to ionizing radiation (such as radiation therapy to treat cancer), and certain medications (nitrofurantoin, methotrexate). Often no cause of fibrosis is identified. This may be called \"idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\".","1096":"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage from the ear secondary to an abnormal communication between the space around the brain and the inner ear. It can occur after trauma, especially a skull fracture. It can also be a congenital defect or from a complication of ear surgery. CSF is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Untreated this problem can lead to meningitis.","1097":"Traumatic injury to the nose is common, with fractures and nose bleeds being the most frequent injuries. The majority of traumatic nose bleeds stop without treatment. Associated injuries commonly occur. Patients with septal hematomas (blue mass on septum), cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea (clear fluid from the nose), malocclusion (malalignment of the teeth), or extra ocular movement defects (double vision) will need their associated injuries managed in conjunction with the nasal trauma.","1098":"Inflammation of the larynx that leads to temporary dysfunction and voice hoarseness. The larynx is the portion of the airway between the pharynx (mouth and upper throat) and the trachea (windpipe). It contains the vocal cords as well as the ligaments and cartilage that support the vocal cords and allow them to function. The disorder is most commonly caused by viral infections and usually lasts several days. Hoarseness that does not go away within 2 weeks should be evaluated by a medical provider to rule out the possibility of laryngeal cancer or other serious disorder.","1099":"A heat-related illness that is often caused by several days of exposure to elevated temperatures and dehydration. Patients experience a fast heart rate, hot flushed skin, and generalized weakness. If not treated heat exhaustion can lead to heat stroke, which can be very serious and life threatening. Risk factors for heat exhaustion include: dehydration, drinking alcohol, age less than 4 or greater than 65, being overweight, not being used to working in hot environments, and working in areas with high heat and humidity.","11":"Arthritis that occurs in patients with psoriasis. The rash of psoriasis usually appears before the joint pain. The disease most often affects patients between the ages of 30-50. 1 in 20 patients with psoriasis develop this form of arthritis. The arthritis is usually mild but in some patients can be severe and debilitating. ","110":"An infection that causes swelling and irritation of the area around the vocal cords leading to the characteristic seal barking cough and noisy breathing (stridor). It is most commonly caused by a viral infection. Corticosteroids are sometimes given to reduce the swelling and shorten the course of the illness. Most cases resolve on their own. Rarely croup can be life threatening.","1100":"A tear in a muscle. Any muscle in the body can be torn and the most common cause is an injury that stretches the muscle suddenly. A direct blow to the muscle can also cause a tear of the muscle. Most of these injuries will heal on their own with simple splinting. If there is an associated ligament or tendon damage then surgery may be needed. ","1101":"Ebola virus infection often causes  damage to the vascular system manifested by bleeding and multi-organ dysfunction. Without intensive supportive care, it can be fatal. The Ebola virus is thought to have originated from fruit bats and then introduced to humans through contact with infected animals. Ebola virus can be transmitted between humans but transmission only occurs when there is direct contact with bodily fluids of a person who is ill. Infected fluids may include blood, sweat, vomit, urine, semen, feces, and saliva. Ebola virus is not airborne, and cannot be transmitted through the air. The 2014 Ebola outbreak is the largest in history, most severely affecting the West African countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. ","1102":"A harmless elevated bilirubin level in the blood that is caused by an abnormal metabolism of bilirubin by the liver. Bilirubin is a breakdown product of red blood cells. The disorder is inherited and one in five Caucasians has a mild form of the condition. The disorder causes an elevated blood level of a kind of bilirubin (unconjugated bilirubin). On occasion, the bilirubin is elevated enough that there is a slight yellow coloring of the skin. Gilbert's disease is otherwise not dangerous and very few other symptoms are experienced.","1103":"Overproduction of red blood cells in the bone marrow. The blood is more prone to form clots (thrombosis) in the arteries, and this can cause complications like stroke or kidney damage. Polycythemia vera occurs because cells in the bone marrow have developed a gene mutation. Polycythemia vera can develop into leukemia. ","1104":"A parasite infection. Most people are not aware that they have been infected because they have either mild or no symptoms. People with impaired immune systems, such as AIDS or cancer, can develop more serious infections including: central nervous system (CNS) disease, eye involvement or lung infection. The parasite can be acquired by handling cat feces, or by eating undercooked infected meat (especially lamb, pork, or deer). Women who are pregnant or want to become pregnant should avoid cat feces and undercooked meat. An infection can lead to spontaneous abortion or fetal abnormalities.","1105":"Symptoms during or after a strep infection characterized by a rash covering most of the body, a strawberry-like appearance of the tongue and usually a high fever. The most common source of scarlet fever is strep throat (a bacterial infection of the throat). Scarlet fever is now relatively rare, and is most likely to occur between ages 5 and 15.","1106":"The heart pumps blood through the arteries and veins. With congestive heart failure, the pumping force of the heart is reduced. Left sided heart failure results in fluid backing up into the lungs causing breathing problems, and right sided heart failure produces fluid in the legs (edema) and the abdomen (ascites). Congestive heart failure (CHF) can have many causes with the most common being coronary artery disease, heart attacks, high blood pressure (hypertension), viral heart infections (myocarditis), congenital heart defects, and valvular heart disease. Patients with known CHF can experience worsening symptoms if they eat too much salt, stop taking their medications or have another co-existing illness such as pneumonia.","1107":"A rare inherited disorder that can cause abnormal mental and physical development. Individuals with PKU do not possess the ability to break down certain parts of protein. This results in the build- up of a specific building block of protein called phenylalanine. This build-up can damage the brain and other organs. If undetected and untreated, PKU results in mental retardation, hyperactivity and seizures.","1108":"A progressive scarring of the lung. There are many causes such as infections, exposure to toxins, radiation, and certain medications. Sometimes the doctors cannot determine why the disorder occurs. If the condition progresses the patient will not be able to supply enough oxygen to their blood. Patients can develop elevated blood pressure in their pulmonary arteries, and the right side of their heart can fail leading to respiratory failure and death. ","1109":"ACE inhibitors are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and are prescribed for blood pressure control and\/or heart failure. Common drugs are lisinopril, captopril, enalapril, and ramipril. Most common side effect is persistent throat tickle and cough. Other side effects include low blood pressure and swelling of the lips and tongue (angioedema).","111":"Normal rhythmic contractions of the upper chambers of the heart (atria) are replaced by rapid irregular twitching of the muscular wall. The lower chambers of the heart (ventricles) respond irregularly causing an irregular and usually rapid heart rate. Atrial fibrillation may come and go (paroxysmal atrial fibrillation) or persist (chronic atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is common, especially in older people. The main causes of this disorder include mitral valve disease, high blood pressure, heart failure, excessive alcohol use, an overactive thyroid, stimulants (cocaine, methamphetamines), and stress from other illnesses.","1110":"Von Willebrand disease is a bleeding disorder that affects the body's ability to form blood clots. It is most often an inherited disorder that results from low levels of Von Willebrand protein. This protein acts as the glue that holds tiny cells called platelets together during the formation of a clot. Von Willebrand disease is relatively common and affects both males and females.","1111":"Mescaline is a hallucinogen obtained from the spineless cactus Peyote (Lophophora Williams). It is mainly used as a recreational drug. In some cultures, it is used during religious rites. Use of this drug can cause agitation, a racing heart and severe vomiting. ","1112":"Extragonadal germ cell tumors are made up of cells that normally reside inside the ovaries or testes (gonads). However, during fetal development they sometimes end up outside the gonads where they can form tumors during life. These tumors are rare. When they do occur, they tend to develop in the lungs, low back, back of the abdomen, or the middle of the brain. ","1113":"The esophagus is the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. Varices are dilated veins most commonly found near the esophagus or stomach. The most common cause of esophageal varices is scarring of the liver (cirrhosis). Cirrhosis causes a back-up of blood in the esophageal veins which leads to the development of varices. Bleeding esophageal varices can be life-threatening. ","1114":"An inherited disease of blood vessels which makes them fragile and prone to bleeding. Patients develop red or reddish-purple collections of abnormal blood vessels called telangiectasias or arterio-venous malformations (AVMs). Patients experience bleeding episodes from the nose, gastrointestinal tract and the brain.","1115":"Adrenal tumors that produce excessive hormones. The adrenal glands sit on top of the kidneys. These glands are responsible for producing a number of hormones including epinephrine and norepinephrine. Pheochromocytomas are adrenal tumors that produce excessive quantities of these hormones. These hormones cause a sudden rise in blood pressure and the other symptoms. These tumors are usually benign, and the disorder is usually seen in 30-50 year olds. ","1116":"A loose fragment of bone or cartilage that causes a painful joint. The knees or elbows are the most common joints involved. The loose fragment may become lodged into the joint causing it to give way or cause it to lock. These loose fragments of bone or joints are sometimes called joint mice. ","1117":"A stab type of wound in the arm. These wounds can damage structures deep to the skin such as blood vessels, nerves, or tendons. The object that caused the wound can carry bacteria or foreign material deep into the wound and cause infections. Puncture wounds from animal or human bites are especially prone to infections. ","1118":"A contagious disease caused by the mumps virus that produces painful swelling of the parotid glands (the salivary glands that lie between the ear and jaw). The virus may involve the testicles, ovaries, pancreas, breasts, brain and meninges. It is most common in children (2 to 12 years), but 10% of adults are susceptible to mumps. Complications can include sterility, hearing loss, encephalitis and rarely death. Mumps is spread by respiratory droplets that are released into the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The virus can also be spread through contact with contaminated objects, surfaces, or eating utensils. The MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccination given in childhood can prevent the disease.","1119":"An inflammation of the stomach and\/or intestinal lining. It is one of the most common causes of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Gastroenteritis is most often caused by viruses, but bacterial infections are also common. The source can be food or direct human-to-human transmission.  This disorder can be very serious in the very young and very old causing life threatening dehydration. Internationally this is one of the leading causes of death of patients of all ages. ","112":"Abnormal cells on the cervix grow out of control. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that opens into the vagina. Cervical cancer is almost always caused by human papilloma virus (HPV). It can often be cured when it is found early. It is usually found at a very early stage by routine cervical cancer screening with Pap and\/or HPV testing. Vaccination against HPV can significantly reduce a women's risk of getting cervical cancer.","1120":"Inflammation of the lymph glands and lymph channels. The most common cause is infection (especially, streptococcal or staphylococcal bacterial infection). The location of the affected gland(s) is usually associated with the site of the underlying infection. ","1121":"Insufficient blood flow to one or both legs that can cause muscle fatigue or cramp-like pain with walking. Symptoms are relieved after resting, and the calf is most commonly affected, but symptoms may be felt in the thighs, buttocks, hips or feet. Peripheral arterial disease from a buildup of plaque in the walls of arteries (atherosclerosis) is the usual cause. As the buildup continues the artery becomes more and more narrow, and can eventually lead to increased infections and loss of the leg.","1122":"Over-ingestion of a drug that can be intentional or accidental. The symptoms and signs of the intoxication as well as the history surrounding the event can be used to determine the offending drug.","1123":"Dandruff is the excessive accumulation of dead skin cells on the scalp. The dead skin cells clump together and cause flakes that are visible on the scalp and clothing. It is a mild form of seborrheic dermatitis","1124":"A common type of headache. The typical migraine headache is throbbing or pulsating, and often is associated with nausea and intolerance to light and sound. Many people experience an aura, usually visual changes, before the headache. The headache is usually intense and often incapacitating and is frequently accompanied by nausea and vomiting and an intolerance to light (photophobia). Migraines are believed to be triggered by brain chemicals, but their exact cause of these headaches is not known. Migraines often first occur during the teenage years and are more common in women. Patients who have family members with migraines are at increased risk to develop these headaches.","1125":"Necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG) is a condition affecting the gums that is caused by a bacterial infection. It is a form of periodontal (gum) disease. But unlike other forms, it typically develops quickly and causes moderate to severe pain. Poor oral hygiene, stress and heavy smoking are the most important factors linked with a higher risk of NUG. Poor nutrition, infections of the mouth or throat, and a weakened immune system also increase the risk.","1126":"An infection of the tonsils. The infection can be caused by a bacterium such as streptococcus or a virus such as Ebstein-Barr virus, which causes infectious mononucleosis. Tonsils are located at the back of the throat.  Rarely, some cases of tonsillitis can turn into an abscess (peritonsillar abscess) requiring drainage of the infected fluid.","1127":"A blood clot caused by bleeding into the scrotum near the testicle. It is usually caused by bleeding into a hydrocele or from trauma to the testicle.","1128":"Invasive lobular carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that begins in the milk glands (lobules) of the breast and eventually spreads outside the glands and into the surrounding tissue. Unlike other types of breast cancer, invasive lobular carcinoma does not typically produce a lump. Instead, it often produces fullness in the breast or thickening of the breast tissue. Invasive lobular carcinoma is responsible for a relatively small percentage of breast cancers. It is most common in older women, postmenopausal women using hormone replacement and women with a history of lobular carcinoma in situ (milk gland cancer that hasn't spread).","1129":"A fracture of the basilar bone of the skull, which is part of the floor of the skull that holds the brain. Fractures in this bone can cause tears in the sack compartments that hold the brain, resulting in a leakage of the cerebral spinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord). The fluid leaks from the nose or the ear and is typically clear and colorless.","113":"Tooth discoloration is caused by stains on the outer layer of the tooth (extrinsic), changes inside the tooth (intrinsic), or age-related changes (combination of extrinsic and intrinsic factors). Coffee, wine, other drinks or foods, and smoking cause extrinsic stains. Intrinsic stains are caused by trauma, too much fluoride during early childhood, or use of tetracycline antibiotics during pregnancy or early childhood. Age-related tooth yellowing has two causes. The outer enamel layer gets thinner, allowing the yellower dentin layer to show through. Extrinsic stains also build up with age.","1130":"Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is an abnormal heart rhythm that originates in the top part of the heart (atrium). The rate is faster than 100 beats per minute and it can be a lot faster. SVT typically occurs suddenly and stops suddenly. The occurrence of SVT increases with age and is more common in women.","1131":"The failure of muscles to relax after a contraction. It is caused by a number of neuromuscular diseases including a form of muscular dystrophy (myoclonic dystrophy or myoclonic muscular dystrophy), and myotonia congenita. It can also occur in normal individuals after vigorous exercise.","1132":"Food poisoning occurs when a patient consumes food or water that contains certain bacteria, viruses, or parasites. The disorder can also occur when the toxins from these organisms are ingested. The most frequent causes are listed here with the food they are commonly associated with in parentheses: Campylobacter (meat and chicken), Shigella (produce), Salmonella (meat, egg yolks, milk, chicken), Clostridium perfringens (meat), Escherichia coli O157:H7 (meat, produce, milk), Giardia lamblia (produce, water), Hepatitis A (food from infected handler, shell fish, water), Noroviruses or Norwalk-like viruses (produce, shellfish), Rotavirus (produce), Staphylococcus aureus (meat, salads, cream sauces, cream-filled pastries), Vibrio vulnificus (shellfish). The best way to avoid illness is to cook food thoroughly. Unfortunately infected food handlers can pass on the organism after the food has been cooked.","1133":"A skin infection caused by a fungus, not a worm. Fungus infections also can affect skin on the scalp (tinea capitis), groin area (tinea cruris, also called jock itch), or feet (tinea pedis, also called athlete's foot). There can be several patches of ringworm on the skin at once. The name comes from the characteristic rash: a red ring surrounding an area of normal appearing skin. The infection can be acquired through contact with infected humans, infected animals, or from contact with objects containing the fungus such as bedding, clothes, or hair brushes.","1134":"An accidental or intentional taking of too much medication or chemical. The symptoms experienced depend on the substance ingested and can range from nausea and vomiting to death.","1135":"Occurs when a child is lifted by their forearm, wrist, or hand pulling the radius (a bone in the forearm) out of its ligament in the elbow. Any other similar mechanism can cause the disorder. It is seen in children less than 5 years old. Immediate pain is experienced and the child will refuse to use the arm. Nursemaid's elbow is also called a radial head subluxation.","1136":"Lazy eye (amblyopia) is a problem with vision in young growing children. In this condition, one eye does not see as well as the other. As the brain develops, it creates pathways that tell the brain how to get the pictures from the eyes. Over time, if the condition is not corrected, the brain will ignore the eye with vision problems and get all information from the normal eye. This can result in permanent visual loss in the abnormal eye.","1137":"Dysphagia means difficulty swallowing while eating. There are many reasons patients can have problems swallowing. Please search \"Dysphagia\" in the symptom section of iTriage for more information on these causes. Some of the causes such as a stroke can be life threatening and require immediate medical attention.","1138":"A finger dislocation occurs when the bones of the fingers (phalanges) are forced from their normal positions. This may occur at the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) or the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints in the hand. As a result, the normal movement of the fingers is disrupted. Dislocations usually occur when the finger is bent beyond its normal range of motion. The dislocation can damage attached tendons and nearby nerves and arteries.","1139":"A defect in the skin or mucous membrane of the mouth caused by trauma. Associated injuries may include the teeth, jaw, lips, tongue, inner cheeks, gums, roof of the mouth (hard or soft palates), neck, or tonsils. If the laceration involves the lips and crosses the juncture between the lighter skin and the redder tissue (vermillion border), the repair tries to accurately approximate the edges of the vermillion border.","114":"Chronic pain is often due to an identifiable cause, such as degenerative arthritis in the lower back or nerve disease. However, it may also develop for no apparent reason. Despite thorough exams and tests, a doctor may be unable to find a specific physical cause.","1140":"An involuntary loss of urine that occurs with coughing, sneezing, laughing, or exercise. The amount of urine that leaks is usually small (not the whole bladder contents). The most common causes are previous childbirth, older age, and previous pelvic or abdominal surgery.","1141":"The tearing of a coronary artery (artery of the heart). It can occur spontaneously or after an injury, such as one that can happen during an angioplasty to relieve an obstruction.","1142":"An inherited disease. Nerve tissue grows abnormally, which can cause serious damage to nerves. This may result in loss of function, pain and numbness. There are 3 different types of neurofibromatosis (NF) with NF-1 being the most common, the other types are referred to as NF-2 and Schwannomatosis (named for the type of cell that grows abnormally). About 3-15% of people with NF-1 will have a malignant tumor resulting in death. However, usually the tumors are not fatal.","1143":"Painful inflammation of a tendon and surrounding sheath. The inflammation can result from: overuse or over stretching of the tendon, trauma, infection, or inflammatory diseases. Tendons are the fibrous attachments of the muscles to the bones. The sheath of the tendon can also become inflamed causing tenosynovitis. De Quervain's tenosynovitis is one of the most common types and occurs at the base of the thumb and lateral wrist. When tenosynovitis is caused by an infection prompt treatment with antibiotics is needed to prevent permanent loss of function.","1144":"A sudden loss of vision in one eye caused by a blockage of blood flow to the retinal artery. The retinal artery supplies blood to the retina. The retina captures the light in the back of the eye and transmits these images to the brain. This condition is sometimes followed by a stroke and is considered very serious. The blockage of the retinal artery is usually due to a piece of plaque that builds up in the carotid arteries in the neck. The carotid arteries supply blood to the brain. The plaque buildup is caused by atherosclerosis, and consists of fat deposits and calcium.","1145":"A pouch that develops in the lining of the lower throat. Swallowed food may enter the pouch. As the pouch fills it can press on the esophagus causing symptoms. Food can spill into the airway and cause an aspiration. Patients can spit up undigested food that was eaten many hours before. Pills can also become lodged in the pouch. The disorder is most often found in those over 50.","1146":"A highly contagious infection of the bronchial tubes and lungs caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. The initial symptoms resemble the common cold, but the cough persists. The coughing can occur in spasms followed by a high-pitched intake of breath that sounds like \"whoop\". The incidence of whooping cough has greatly decreased in the world due to immunization. It is most common in children and can be serious in infants less than 6 months. In recent years there have been more cases in adults secondary to declining adult immunity from the original immunizations given as a child.","1147":"An infectious condition caused by a parasite (Trypanosoma cruzi ) which is transmitted to humans through the bite of the infected reduviid bug (also called triatomine bugs), consumption of contaminated food, blood transfusion, organ transplantation and accidental laboratory exposure. It can also be passed from an infected woman to her baby during pregnancy. It is commonly found in Central and South America and Mexico and is more prevalent among the poor. The acute condition has only minor symptoms. The chronic phase can result in heart failure and death.","1148":"The carotid arteries branch off of the aorta and supply blood to your brain. A dissection is a tear in the inner lining of an artery. It may occur spontaneously or after trauma to the neck. The tear in the artery allows blood to leak into the artery wall which can result in blockage and decreased blood flow. This disorder is serious as about half of affected people suffer a stroke after the dissection. Dissections have been associated with motor vehicle accidents, blunt trauma to the neck, medical procedures, any exercise that involves rapid movements or stretching of the neck, and, rarely, with chiropractic neck manipulations. Patients with connective tissue diseases are at increased risk for this disease.","1149":"Elbow fractures most often occur when a person falls and lands on an outstretched hand. Sometimes the initial X-ray does not demonstrate the fracture but shows fluid in the joint from bleeding. The majority of patients heal up completely in 3-4 weeks with immobilization (splint or sling).","115":"Usually occurs after blunt trauma to the chest. In the elderly or in those with osteoporosis (weak bones), the trauma can be less forceful, such as hard coughing. The underlying lung can be injured causing a collapsed lung (pneumothorax) or bruise of the lung (contusion). Multiple rib fractures can prevent normal respiration and be life threatening.","1150":"A connection that develops between the carotid artery and the cavernous sinus. The cavernous sinus is one of the venous channels draining blood away from the brain. The carotid artery and cranial nerves pass through this sinus. The cavernous sinus is located at the base of the skull, behind the eyes. Carotid cavernous fistulae may form following closed or penetrating head trauma, surgical damage, rupture of an intracavernous aneurysm, in association with connective tissue disorders, or vascular diseases. A fistula may also be congenital (present at birth), an inherited disorder of connective tissue, related to, or a complication of atherosclerosis hypertension or pregnancy and childbirth. ","1151":"Produces distortion of the neck secondary to spasm of the neck muscles. Also called cervical dystonia. The head is involuntarily turned to one side during an attack. The disorder can occur from birth to adulthood but is most common in young and middle-aged women. Some cases resolve on their own but others need specific therapy. The cause can be inherited (spasmodic torticollis), acquired after an injury, or unknown (idiopathic torticollis).","1152":"Traumatic injuries that damage an artery or vein. These injuries can be very serious and result in life threatening bleeding. Lacerations, knife wounds, and gunshot wounds are the most common cause of blood vessel damage. Treatment is dependent on the location of the injury. Larger arteries and arteries feeding important areas need emergent repair to prevent death of the tissue the artery was supplying with blood. In general veins are not sewn back together unless they are large.","1153":"Inflammation of the lungs caused by an allergic reaction in the lungs. The disease is caused by breathing in dust. In most cases, the condition occurs because the body\u2019s immune system reacts to inhaled microscopic particles. The immune reaction, designed to rid the lung of the dust, actually injures the lung, instead. Fluid and white blood cells enter the breathing sacs in the lungs (alveoli) and produce symptoms that resemble an infection of lung (pneumonia). This disorder is more common in farmers and those that raise birds. Most patients recover completely after they remove themselves from the allergic stimulus.","1154":"Dermographism is a normal body reaction common in people who have allergic tendencies. The name \"dermatographism\" means writing on the skin. When dermatographism occurs, a stroke or scratch on the skin causes a puffy red line to appear. This resembles a \"hive.\" 2-5% of people have this skin response to scratching. ","1155":"An enlargement of one or more veins within the scrotum forms a varicocele. They are similar to varicose veins in the leg. They are associated with low sperm counts and diminished sperm motility. However, most men with varicoceles have adequate sperm counts and are fertile. It is a common disorder affecting 1 in 6 men. Due to the venous drainage of the testicles, they are more commonly found on the left.","1156":"Dental caries is the scientific term for tooth decay or cavities. It is caused by specific types of bacteria. They turn the sugar and starches from food into acids. The acids dissolve minerals in the tooth's hard outer layer, the enamel. As the enamel and the dentin layer under it break down, a hole (cavity) can form.  Tooth decay can be painful if it reaches the tooth's inner layer, the pulp, which contains nerve fibers. Tooth decay is an infection. If it is not treated, the nerve will die and infect the bone under the tooth.","1157":"Nerve damage which prevents the correct transmission of messages from the bladder to the brain. For the bladder to work properly, the muscles and nerves must work together to hold urine in the bladder and release it correctly. Nerves carry messages from the bladder to the brain, letting the brain know when the bladder is full. In a neurogenic bladder, the nerves that are supposed to carry these messages malfunction. Some causes include nerve disease such as multiple sclerosis; diabetes, trauma to the brain or spinal cord; and certain infections.","1158":"A chronic inflammatory autoimmune disorder that may affect the skin, joints, kidneys, and other organs. The disease is thought to be due to misfiring of the body's immune system so that it attacks organs of the body. The result is chronic (long-term) inflammation that can affect many parts of the body, including arthritis, skin rash, kidney disease, brain inflammation, and heart problems.","1159":"The neck contains many important and vulnerable structures. Trauma can be blunt from a motor vehicle accident or fall, or be penetrating from a gunshot wound or stabbing. The following injuries can occur: tracheal (causing airway obstruction); esophageal (leading to mediastinitis); carotid artery or vena cava (causing exsanguinations or stroke); cervical spine (sometimes resulting in fracture and\/or paralysis).","116":"The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) in the wrist consists of cartilage and ligaments and is located on the side of the wrist near the little finger (ulnar side). The TFCC helps the wrist to move normally and stabilizes the bones of the wrist. An injury, usually from a fall, can occur to the TFCC resulting in an over stretching of the ligament or cartilage (sprain), or a tear of these structures. Some injuries to the TFCC can result in persistent pain and swelling (chronic injury).","1160":"Yaws is an infectious disease that occurs in the tropics. It is caused by the bacteria Treponema pallidum. This is similar to the bacteria that causes syphilis. But yaws is caused by a slightly different version of the bacteria and is not sexually transmitted. The disease affects the skin and bones and occurs in three stages. The last stage is the most severe and results in significant facial disfiguration. However, only ten percent of cases progress to this stage. The number of cases of the disease has decreased dramatically since the 1950's.","1161":"Hydronephrosis is swelling inside the part of the kidney called the pelvis.  Hydronephrosis can occur on one side of the body (unilateral) or both sides (bilateral). Hydronephrosis is not a disease in and of itself. It is caused by blockage of urine flow out of the kidney. The blockage can be in the tube that connects the kidney to the bladder (ureter), inside the bladder or inside the urethra (the tube that drains urine outside the body. Causes include an enlarged prostate in men,  kidney stones, scarring, pregnancy and tumors.","1162":"A complete or partial set of artificial teeth. Poorly fitting dentures can cause painful gums, jaw pain and swelling of the gums.","1163":"An abnormal and malignant growth of the cells of the tongue. It usually occurs along the side of the tongue or at the tip. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of cancer. Risk factors include oral human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, overuse of alcohol, smoking tobacco and chewing tobacco. Left untreated the cancer can spread to the gums, lower jaw, lymph nodes, neck, and floor of the mouth.","1164":"Calcium channel blockers are blood pressure medications. Overdoses can occur accidentally or intentionally. Severe overdoses can result in very low blood pressure, slow heart rates and death. Common drugs in this class are: Amlodipine (Norvasc), Diltiazem (Cardizem, Dilacor), Nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia), Verapamil (Calan, Isoptin, Verelan). Accidental ingestion of even one pill in an infant requires immediate medical attention as it can be serious and even fatal.","1165":"Cancer of the thyroid gland. The thyroid is a gland in the front of the neck just below the Adam's apple. The thyroid produces thyroid hormone that regulates blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature. There are multiple types of thyroid cancer, depending on which cells of the thyroid are growing out of control including. Types include papillary thyroid cancer, follicular thyroid cancer, medullary thyroid cancer, anaplastic thyroid cancer, and thyroid lymphoma. Thyroid cancer is rare but is more common in people exposed to large doses of radiation or with a family history of enlargement of the thyroid cancer. ","1166":"A virus that is a common cause of upper respiratory tract infections. The virus can also cause gastroenteritis and conjunctivitis. These viral infections are common in children and can be very contagious.","1167":"A fracture is a break in a bone. Fractures can be simple or complex in multiple pieces (comminuted). The fracture can bleed into the surrounding tissue resulting in bruising and in severe cases a limb threatening condition, compartment syndrome. The fracture can also injure adjacent nerves, tendons or blood vessels.","1168":"A lung disease involving the destruction and enlargement of the bronchial tubes. It is often caused by recurrent inflammation or infection of the airways. It most often begins in childhood as a complication from infection or inhaling a foreign object, but it can develop at any age.","1169":"A stab wound to the lip. The object that caused the wound can carry bacteria or foreign material deep into the wound and cause infections. Puncture wounds from animal or human bites are especially prone to infections. Facial infections can be severe causing nerve damage and extension of the infection into the brain. A common way to puncture the lower lip is to fall onto the face -- the teeth can cut through the lip from the inside on impact. This is sometimes called a \"button hole\" lip injury.","117":"A condition in pregnancy in which high blood glucose (sugar) levels develop. About 3%-5% of all pregnant women in the U.S. are diagnosed with gestational diabetes. The following conditions increase the risk of developing gestational diabetes: being over 25, family history of type 2 diabetes, having prediabetes or prior gestational diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, and being of non-white descent. Women with this disorder are more likely to have abnormally high birth weight babies (macrosomia), babies with low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), babies that develop type 2 diabetes later in life, premature deliveries, and problems delivering the baby secondary to the large size of the baby.","1170":"One or more painful joints resulting from degeneration of cartilage in the joints. When cartilage thins, bone just beneath the cartilage thickens to absorb more impact. On x-ray, there is a smaller amount of separation between bones than is normal (this is caused by thinning of cartilage). Thickening of bone at the edge of a joint can create ridges of bone. When a ridge of bone is seen on a 2-dimensional x-ray it is called a bone spur in x-ray reports. Osteoarthritis commonly occurs more in fingers, thumb and wrist, knees, hips and spine. It is more common after age 45.","1171":"Keloids are overgrowths of fibrous tissue at the site of skin injury. The growths usually extend beyond the boundaries of the original scar. Frequently, keloids re-grow even after removal (excision) is attempted. ","1172":"Aphakia is the absence of a lens in the eye. The lens is responsible for focusing light on the retina (a layer of camera-like film on the back of the eye). Aphakia may be present at birth (congenital) or occur as the result of surgical removal or trauma. Absence of a lens causes farsightedness (inability to see close) and inability to focus vision at different distances (accommodation). These symptoms can be improved with glasses, contact lenses or artificial lens implantation.","1173":"Describes the range of alcohol effects on an unborn child. The problems may range from mild to severe. Alcohol can cause the unborn child to have permanent physical or mental problems.","1174":"Inflammation of the cervix that can be caused by an infection, a chemical irritant or an allergic reaction. The cervix is the end of the uterus. Common organisms include gonorrhea, Chlamydia, herpes, genital warts or trichomonas. Chemical irritation or allergic reactions are commonly in response to latex condoms or spermicide.","1175":"The act of administering a vaccine. Vaccines have greatly reduced the incidence of infectious diseases. They are especially important for children, older adults and people visiting other countries. Adverse effects of vaccines include: fever, chills, sore injection site, and redness of injection site.","1176":"Trauma is classified into blunt and penetrating. Blunt trauma includes motor vehicle accidents, falls, and assaults that involve blunt instruments such as a bat. Penetrating trauma includes gunshot wounds and stabbings. Blunt trauma is much more common. The injury caused by the trauma is dependent on the body part involved, the extent of damage and the health of the injured party. The consequences of most blunt trauma can be reduced by following certain guidelines such as wearing seat belts and helmets.","1177":"One of the nerves exiting the cervical spine is not functioning normally causing nerve root dysfunction including pain, weakness, tingling, and numbness. Cervical radiculopathy most often is caused by compression from a herniated disc, fracture, hematoma, spinal stenosis, or from an abnormal fluid collection.","1178":"A sideways growth of the toenail into skin. The condition may also occur in the fingernail as well.  This growth causes redness, swelling, and pain. Sometimes a bacterial or fungal infection can occur along with the inflammation caused by the abnormal nail growth. The following conditions lead to an increased chance of getting this condition: playing sports, wearing tight or narrow shoes, repeated foot injuries, long toes, poor foot hygiene, repeated toe infections, having diabetes, and abnormal nail growth. Trimming the nail straight across can help prevent this problem from occurring. If left untreated the surrounding skin can become infected (cellulitis). ","1179":"A disorder of the brain and nervous system that occurs when reactivated chicken-pox virus (varicella zoster) causes specific symptoms in an adult. Reactivated chicken pox is also known as \"shingles\" or \"zoster\" infection. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a shingles (zoster) infection that specifically affects one or more nerves near to the inner ear. Affected patients experience paralysis of muscles on one side of the face, ear pain, hearing loss or ringing in the ear (tinnitus).","118":"A partial seizure is related to an abnormal discharge of electricity in the brain. Normally, electrical signals in the brain flow in regular controlled pathways. In a partial seizure, the normal electrical pathways are disrupted, resulting in an abnormal discharge of electricity in an area of the brain. The symptoms vary greatly depending on where in the brain the discharge occurs. A simple partial seizure does not result in a change in consciousness, while a complex partial seizure does.  ","1180":"Herpes is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV-type 1 commonly causes oral lesions like fever blisters on the mouth or face (oral herpes). HSV-type 2 typically affects the genital area (genital herpes). The rash of HSV may resolve but the virus may remain dormant within the nerve cells. The sores of HSV may return when a person is experiencing emotional or physical stress or immune suppression.  However, attacks of herpes may recur for no identifiable reason.","1181":"Inflammation of the thyroid gland. \r\nThe inflamed gland can release an excessive amount of thyroid hormone (hyperthyroid), the correct amount, or too little (hypothyroid) depending on the cause and the stage of the disease. Many people with thyroiditis have permanent damage to the thyroid gland causing hypothyroidism that requires thyroid replacement for life. The types of thyroiditis include: Hashimoto's thyroiditis, subacute granulomatous thyroiditis, postpartum thyroiditis, subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis, and drug-induced thyroiditis.","1182":"The esophagus is the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. An esophageal cyst is a duplication of the esophagus usually involving the last third of the esophagus. The cysts can compress surrounding structures causing difficulties swallowing, problems breathing, or heart arrhythmias. This disorder is rare and many patients do not have any symptoms.","1183":"Malignant mesothelioma is a rare form of cancer that involves the membrane around the lungs. The most common cause of mesothelioma is exposure to asbestos. Men are more likely than women to develop this type of cancer presumably due to their greater occupational exposure to asbestos. ","1184":"A narrowing of the aorta, the large blood vessel that travels out of the heart delivering oxygen-rich blood to the body. This narrowing is usually located near where the aorta attaches to the heart. The heart has to work harder to pump blood through this narrowing. The symptoms experienced depend on the extent of the aorta narrowing and how long the condition has been present. This is a congenital abnormality and male infants are twice as likely to be born with this condition as females. Some patients with this disease will have other congenital heart defects as well. ","1185":"Not having enough blood platelets. Platelets are blood cells made in the bone marrow that are needed for effective blood clotting.  Patients with this disorder experience bleeding into the skin (petechiae and purpura) and bleeding from almost any organ. The disorder can be life threatening. There are many types and causes of thrombocytopenia, such as: immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), drug induced thrombocytopenia from chemotherapy or heparin therapy, alcohol abuse, myelodysplastic syndrome and other bone marrow diseases, and infections.","1186":"The uterus has sunk from its normal location and extends into the vagina. When severe, it can project outside the vagina. The disorder occurs when the ligaments and muscles that hold the uterus in place become stretched and damaged. Multiple child births and the loss of muscle mass and strength associated with aging are the major causes.","1187":"A migraine headache associated with neurologic symptoms. The neurologic symptoms can be blurring vision, double vision, facial weakness, arm or leg weakness, numbness, or confusion. Some authorities believe the symptoms come from a temporary narrowing of a blood vessel in the brain. These symptoms can be very scary and can be mistaken for a stroke. A patient with this disorder should seek immediate medical attention if they have new neurologic symptoms with their headache. ","1188":"Morton's neuroma is a non-cancerous swelling of nerve tissue in the foot. The neuroma usually develops between the third and fourth toes and it usually only involves one foot. The disease is more common in women than men and is associated with high-heeled shoes and obesity.","1189":"Sandhoff disease is a rare inherited disorder that results in nerve cell damage in the brain and spinal cord. Individuals with Sandhoff disease are lacking a chemical (hexosaminidase A) that breaks down a fatty material called ganglioside GM2. If this material is not broken down, it will build up and cause damage to nerve cells. There are two forms of the disease. One occurs from birth and the other occurs between the teens and thirties. Individuals with Sandhoff disease may experience paralysis, deafness, blindness and death. The disease is very similar to Tay-Sachs disease but rarely occurs in Ashkenazi Jews.  ","119":"Rosacea is a common skin disease of adults that is characterized by a red face and in some cases acne-like pimples. The redness is caused by swelling of blood vessels just under the skin and is primarily confined to the cheeks, nose, forehead and chin. Some cases may involve the neck and chest and other cases may progress to dilated small blood vessels (telangiectasias) and persistent redness in the center of the face. The eyes can be affected causing redness and itchiness and eyelids can swell. Rarely, individuals may develop rhinophyma (enlarged nose).Rosacea is more common in women and fair-skinned adults. Many aggravating factors have been reported to worsen rosacea. They include: sun, stress, alcohol, spicy food, extreme temperatures, cosmetics and medications","1190":"A disorder that causes chronic pain, tenderness, sweating and swelling of the affected area. The arms and legs are most often involved. The exact cause of this disorder is not known but is thought to involve damage to the nerves resulting in the symptoms experienced. Complex regional pain syndrome usually occurs after an injury or surgery to the area. There are two types: in Type 1, there is no obvious injury to the nerve can be identified; In Type 2 an injury to the nerve has occurred. Most people suffer from Type 1. Type 1 previously was called reflex sympathetic dystrophy, and Type 2 previously was called causalgia.","1191":"The most common steroids abused are anabolic steroids. They can be taken orally, intramuscularly or as a cream. The major reasons for steroid abuse are to improve athletic performance and increase muscle size. These activities can have serious adverse effects such as: heart attacks, stroke and liver cancer.","1192":"A skin infection usually caused by bacteria. Bacteria can enter into the skin through a cut or insect bite and spread to deeper tissues causing an infection. If it is not treated with antibiotics, the infection can spread to the blood or lymph nodes. The most common bacteria are staphylococcus and streptococcus species. A particular staphylococcus species called Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is becoming a more common cause. People with depressed immune systems as with diabetes, cancer, HIV, chronic steroid use, and autoimmune diseases are more likely to develop cellulitis.\r\n","1193":"A scratch (abrasion) to the transparent covering of the center of the eye called the cornea. The cornea allows light to enter the eye, where it strikes the retina and is eventually interpreted by the brain as vision. Trauma to the eye can cause a scratch (abrasion) to the cornea. If the abrasion does not heal correctly an infection can develop resulting in permanent scarring and decreased vision. If the abrasion is caused by metal, a rust ring can develop in the cornea. This rust ring will need to be removed to prevent scarring of the cornea. ","1194":"Bleeding disorders are a group of conditions involving the body's blood clotting process. Such disorders can lead to heavy and prolonged bleeding after an injury. Causes of excessive bleeding include: medications commonly called blood thinners, such as warfarin, other oral anticoagulants, clopidogrel, and aspirin; low platelets (thrombocytopenia); liver failure; and hemophilia.","1195":"Pemphigoid is a rare skin condition that results in large fluid-filled blisters on areas such as the lower abdomen, upper thigh and armpit. It occurs most often in individuals older than sixty. Pemphigoid may be life-threatening and requires prompt medical attention.","1196":"An infection of the skin caused by the group A Streptococcus bacteria. It can affect children and adults. A cut in the skin, lymph drainage problems, and skin ulcers increase the risk of infection. 20% of cases involve the face.","1197":"Conditions in which the intervertebral disc is infected or inflamed. The intervertebral discs are the cushioning structures between the bones of the back. Discitis can develop through bacteria in the blood being delivered to the disc space, or from inflammation caused by an autoimmune disorder. Infections can also spread from adjacent infections and occasionally from diagnostic testing or surgery.","1198":"A deformity of the outer ear secondary to trauma. The injury causes bleeding and bruising in the soft tissue of the ear, and if this blood is not removed the ear can become permanently deformed with a shriveled appearance. The injury can also pull the skin away from the cartilage. The cartilage gets its blood supply from the overlying skin and the accumulated blood and pulling away of the skin can cause the cartilage to die resulting in scarring and the deformity seen. ","1199":"Pericoronitis is an inflammation of the tissue around a wisdom tooth (third molar). This happens when the tissue traps food or debris and attracts bacteria. It can occur around a wisdom tooth that is partially grown-in or is still completely under the gums (impacted).","12":"Tinea versicolor is a common fungal rash of the skin characterized by areas of hyper and hypo-pigmented skin (dark and light). It is caused by a yeast species called Malassezia that normally lives on our skin. When it overgrows, it most commonly affects the trunk, back, abdomen and extremities. Less commonly, it can affect the face, genitals or scalp. The rash is more likely to appear on the skin of teenagers and young adults. Some people have a genetic predisposition for the rash. In these people, the rash keeps recurring. ","120":"Ligaments are strong, fibrous bands of tissue that hold bones together near joints. This provides stability. Trauma or over use can stretch a ligament or cause microscopic tears, producing a sprain. Ligament sprains can cause enough swelling and pain that it makes use of the joint difficult or impossible. ","1200":"Inflammation in the mediastinum, usually from an infection. The mediastinum is the area in the center of the chest between the lungs and contains the heart, aorta, vena cava, windpipe (trachea), esophagus, and thymus gland. Causes include chest surgery, cancer, and a ruptured esophagus from vomiting or an endoscopy. The disorder may be life threatening if not treated early.","1201":"Inflammation of the pancreas. Normally digestive enzymes from the pancreas are only allowed to flow into areas of the digestive tract that are protected by mucus. Inflammation of the pancreas can expose unprotected pancreas tissues to digestive enzymes, so pancreatitis can cause serious damage and scarring of the pancreas, and inflammation can spread. Pancreatitis has many causes with alcohol and gallstones being the most common. ","1202":"A food allergy is a reaction by the body's immune system to something in a food. The body produces a reaction that can vary from mild (itching, nausea) to severe (throat swelling, shortness of breath). Food allergies usually occur within 30 minutes of eating but have been known to occur as late as 4-6 hours after eating. Any food can cause an allergic reaction but certain foods are more likely to cause the reaction than others (peanuts, egg, soy, shellfish, wheat, milk).","1203":"The effects of physical child abuse often include multiple fractures that occurred at different times in the past. It may also include numerous other signs of injury, such as skin burns or bruises. Physical abuse tends to occur at moments of greatest stress, when someone strikes out in anger at the child. Many of those who commit physical abuse have been abused themselves as children. ","1204":"A rare disease that causes the skin and underlying tissue to become hard and inelastic. Scleroderma can affect only the skin or involve other parts of the body. This disorder is felt to be caused by an over active immune system which attacks the body (autoimmune disease). The disease can be very serious leading to fibrous scarring of the esophagus, heart, lungs and kidneys, and carries an average 12 year survival rate from the time of diagnosis. Scleroderma is most often found in patients 30-50 years of age and is more common in women.","1205":"A skin disorder that causes persistent excessively dry skin. The disorder is genetic (passed down from family) in most instances. The dead skin cells tend to accumulate like scales instead of falling off.","1206":"Inflammation of a single joint or multiple joints. There are many causes including infection, and inflammatory conditions such as: osteoarthritis, gout, pseudogout, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriasis.","1207":"Chilblains, also known as pernio, occurs with a combination of cold air and humidity. It most often happens when hands, feet, ears or nose are suddenly rewarmed after being very cold. The symptoms of itching, red patches, swelling and blistering, occur from inflammation of the small blood vessels secondary to the rapid temperature change. The disorder does not cause permanent damage unless an associated infection occurs. Chilblains can re-occur with repeated exposure to the cold. Chilblains may occur more often in people with autoimmune diseases.","1208":"A latex allergy is the abnormal reaction of the immune system to the plant proteins that make up latex or the chemicals in the latex. Latex is used to make many items used in hospitals like gloves and IV tubing. It is also used in a variety of common place items such as balloons, nipples on baby bottles, tires, toys and condoms. Individuals with latex allergy need to pay close attention to potential latex exposures and make efforts to avoid them.","1209":"Occurs when the growing end of the thigh bone (femur) grows in a way that it no longer fits in the hip socket correctly. The disorder usually occurs in children between 11 and 16 years old, and is more common in boys and in children who are overweight. If diagnosed and treated early full recovery can occur, if left untreated the end of the femur can die due to interruption of its blood supply (avascular necrosis).","121":"A viral exanthem is a generalized red rash caused by a viral infection. They are most common in children, especially those that have not been vaccinated against measles, rubella and chicken pox. Many infections result in viral exanthems such as adenovirus infections, mononucleosis, measles, German measles, fifths disease and chicken pox. Viral exanthems usually resolve within two weeks without specific treatment. ","1210":"Peyronie's disease is the inflammation and scarring along the shaft of the penis that result in an abnormal curvature of the penis. A mild curvature of the penis is common and considered normal. But a more severe curvature is most likely related to Peyronie's disease unless there has been trauma. Most cases are asymptomatic but other cases result in some degree of sexual dysfunction. It does appear to run in families and is most common between the ages of 45 and 60.  ","1211":"Inflammation of the lung caused by eosinophils. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that increases during an allergic reaction. The eosinophils fill the lung air spaces causing symptoms similar to pneumonia. Most cases of Loeffler syndrome are secondary to an allergic reaction from a medication or a parasite infection such as the worm Ascaris. In some cases the cause is never found. This disorder is rare but if left untreated can be serious.","1212":"A red or pink rash occurring on body areas covered by clothing. Blocked sweat glands lead to discomfort and itching. Heat rash is common in babies and adults in hot, humid climates.","1213":"A tumor in the cavernous sinus. The cavernous sinus is one of the venous channels draining blood away from the brain. The carotid artery and cranial nerves pass through this sinus. The cavernous sinus is located at the base of the skull, behind the eyes. A tumor in this sinus can cause headache, visual problems and headache. ","1214":"A rare and life threatening blood disorder. Blood clots develop in the small blood vessels of many of the organs of the body. These clots cause damage to the kidneys, brain and lungs. These blood clots also consume most of the platelets in the body resulting in a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia). TTP is associated with pregnancy, certain cancers, HIV infection, autoimmune diseases, medications, and serious infections (sepsis).","1215":"Chest trauma can result from penetrating trauma such as a stabbing or a gunshot wound, or from blunt trauma such as a motor vehicle accident or a fall. The lungs, heart, aorta and esophagus are the most seriously injured organs. Significant chest trauma can be fatal if undiagnosed and untreated.","1216":"A rare progressive disorder characterized by inflammation, thickening, and scarring of bile ducts in the liver and below the liver. Bile made in the liver enters bile ducts that carry it to the intestine. Sclerosing cholangitis scars these ducts (the cause is not known). If the scarred ducts do not clear bile, a chemical called bilirubin accumulates in the bloodstream causing jaundice. Continued scarring results in liver failure (cirrhosis). Sclerosing cholangitis is more likely to occurs in people who have ulcerative colitis. The only cure for sclerosing cholangitis is a liver transplant. This disorder is more common in men and is usually seen in patients 35-45 years of age.","1217":"A fungal infection caused by the Histoplasma capsulatum fungus. The fungus infects people throughout the world.  In the U.S., the fungus is most common in the southeastern, mid-Atlantic, and central states. The fungus grows as mold in the soil and enters the body through the lungs when people breathe in infected particles. There are three types of infection, an acute lung infection, a chronic lung infection, and an infection that involves the entire body (disseminated). The initial infection can cause symptoms such as cough and fever but some people will not experience any symptoms (asymptomatic). The chronic lung infection can lead to persistent coughing, weakness, fever and lung scaring. The disseminated infection is more common in the very young, the very old, and in those with a weakened immune system. The disseminated infection can be lethal. ","1218":"An infectious sexually transmitted disease of the reproductive organs. It involves the urethra (the tube leading from bladder to the outside of the body) in males, and in females, the cervix, uterus and fallopian tubes. The rectum, throat, joints, and eyes can sometimes be involved in both sexes. If untreated gonorrhea can cause pelvic inflammatory disease, which can lead to sterility in women.","1219":"Retinoblastoma is a rare cancer of the eye. It involves the light sensing membrane in the back of the eye called the retina. It is a cancer that is often hereditary and usually affects children before the age of five. It causes five percent of all childhood blindness but, with treatment, vision can often be spared. Children diagnosed with retinoblastoma have an increased risk of other forms of cancer later in life. ","122":"An intestinal disease caused by the bacteria shigella. The main sign of infection is diarrhea, which is often bloody. The infection is acquired through direct contact with infected stool, or obtained by eating contaminated food, or drinking contaminated water. Young children are most susceptible. Patients with normal immune systems will generally recover without treatment. Shigella can result in severe dehydration, seizures, toxic megacolon, rectal prolapse and hemolytic uremic syndrome.","1220":"A disorder characterized by persistent exaggerated worry and tension without any clearly identifiable reason. There is a sense of fear or apprehension accompanied by some or all of the following signs: muscle tension, restlessness, palpitations, rapid breathing, jitteriness, suspicion, confusion, decreased concentration, or fear of losing control. The exact cause of this disorder is not known but it is likely related to both genetic and environmental factors.","1221":"Retinal artery occlusion is the blockage of the blood flow through the artery that supplies blood to the light-sensitive layer of the eye called the retina. Within minutes, the cells of the retina begin to die without blood flow. This is a true eye (ophthalmologic) emergency. The blockage occurs as a result of a build-up of clot in the retinal artery (thrombus) or a clot that travels from a distant site, usually the heart, and lodges in the retinal artery (embolus). Other more infrequent causes include inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis), trauma and sickle cell disease.","1222":"Decompression sickness or the bends are the symptoms associated with a rapid decrease in surrounding pressure. This most often occurs in scuba divers but also can occur in airplane pilots. When the diver breathes compressed air, extra oxygen and nitrogen enter the blood stream. If the surrounding pressure decreases rapidly during the diver's trip to the surface, the bubbles are not completely absorbed and remain in the blood stream and tissue. These nitrogen bubbles are the cause of the symptoms of the bends. Certain factors increase the risk of developing the bends. Those include smoking, alcohol use, age greater than 30, obesity, poor physical fitness and cold water diving.","1223":"Herpangina is a viral illness that most commonly affects young children. Children usually complain of fever and sore throat. The sore throat is the result of tiny painful blisters on the soft palate. The disease usually resolves on its own with only symptomatic treatment. Coxsackie A is the name of the virus that most commonly causes herpangina. The disease is most often seen in the summer months. ","1224":"Ewing's sarcoma is a rare cancer that grows in a bone or less commonly in soft tissue. Most cases occur between the ages of 10 and 20. Rarely, the tumor develops after the age of twenty. The majority of people with this cancer are Caucasian. ","1225":"Periorbital cellulitis is an infection of the eyelid or skin surrounding the eye. (This is different from \"orbital cellulitis\" which is infection of the muscles and fat of the eye socket.) Periorbital cellulitis is more common in children and frequently occurs from a minor scratch or injury to the skin around the eye.","1226":"Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung is the growth of abnormal cells in the lung. These abnormal cells increase in number and produce a tumor. Squamous cell carcinoma is one of the non-small cell lung cancers.  Most squamous cell tumors tend to start in the center of lungs and often spread to other parts of the body. Current or previous smokers, people with asbestos or radon exposure are at greater risk for development of this type of cancer. ","1227":"Concussion symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, memory problems, cognitive difficulties, vertigo (head \"spinning\") and personality changes can last for weeks and sometimes months after the impact that caused the concussion. It is important to avoid a second head injury during this period since severe and permanent damage can occur (second impact syndrome).","1228":"A common type of birthmark seen in a newborn. It is present in one third of newborns, and most often is temporary. A salmon patch occurs from the dilation of blood vessels and can become more apparent when the child cries. Another name for a salmon patch is a \u201dstork bite.\u201d The medical name is nevus simplex.","1229":"Benzodiazepines (Valium, Xanax, Ativan) are tranquilizers and are commonly prescribed for anxiety, panic attacks, and as muscle relaxants. Abuse is common and may result from initial appropriate use of the medication. The withdrawal symptoms can be quite severe and can include confusion and seizures. Patients are typically weaned off the medication over 1-2 months depending on which drug is being abused.","123":"A subluxation is the partial dislocation of a joint or tissue. Most subluxations involving joints require medical attention to help move the joint back into place (reduction). Examples of subluxations include nursemaid\u2019s elbow and movement of the lens in eye, usually from trauma.","1230":"Results from the increased presence of cortisol in the body. The disease is caused by a tumor or excess growth (hyperplasia) of the pituitary gland. This gland is located at the base of the brain. The gland produces too much ACTH resulting in excess cortisol. Cortisol controls the body's use of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins and also helps reduce the immune system's response to swelling (inflammation). ","1231":"Also known as halitosis, or breath that has an unpleasant odor. Usually the cause is bacteria in the mouth, but bad breath can also be caused by poor dental hygiene, infections in the mouth, respiratory tract infections, dry mouth, acid reflux, diabetes, and a variety of illnesses.","1232":"Viruses are capsules with genetic material inside. They are much smaller than bacteria. They enter cells of the body and use the cells to produce more viruses eventually killing the cells. The cell death and the body's immune response to fight the virus cause the symptoms experienced. Viruses cause a whole host of diseases that range from the common cold and flu to AIDS and hemorrhagic fever. Viral infections do not respond to antibiotics. There are only a few anti-viral medications available. Vaccines can prevent some viral infections.","1233":"A shoulder sprain occurs when the ligaments (bands of tissue that connect two bones) of the shoulder are stretched or torn. The injury can result from forceful twisting of the arm, a fall onto an outstretched arm, or a direct blow. Sprains can usually be categorized into the following three grades: Grade 1 - stretch, Grade II - partial tear, Grade III - complete tear.   ","1234":"Caused by the parasite, Leishmania. It is transmitted to humans from the bite of a sand fly. There are two forms: a cutaneous form involving the skin and mucous membranes, and a visceral form involving organs within the body. The parasite is found in every continent except Australia. In the Americas, leishmaniasis can be found in Mexico and South America.","1235":"A skin infection at one corner of a fingernail or toenail. Pus containing bacteria collects beneath the skin and causes painful swelling. A paronychia usually forms where there is an ingrown area of nail. An ingrown nail is a margin of nail that pokes into the skin, near the top of the nail. Ingrown nails are often caused by trimming the corner of a nail too short .","1236":"Pancytopenia is a medical condition that results in significantly reduced amounts of all blood components. Red blood cells are reduced, as well as white blood cells and platelets. There are multiple causes of pancytopenia including cancer, infection, vitamin deficiency, auto-immune disorders, medications and bone marrow abnormalities. Pancytopenia is a serious medical condition and requires prompt medical treatment.","1237":"Two main causes: penetrating trauma from gunshot wounds or stabbing, or blunt trauma from a motor vehicle accident or fall. Any of the organs can be damaged including: intestines, stomach, liver, spleen, kidneys, bladder, or aorta.","1238":"A viral infection caused by varicella (reactivated chickenpox virus). After recovery from chickenpox, some virus particles continue to survive for decades. This surviving virus lives in clusters of nerve cells called nerve roots where it is protected from your immune system. The virus re-emerges many years later causing painful lesions that look like pimples. They typically appear on only one side of the body and are localized to one area. Stress, old age and other infections can cause the re-emergence of the virus. Also called herpes zoster.","1239":"A syndrome where the stem cells in the bone marrow fail to develop normally into the white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets needed for normal bodily function. There is a range of severity with some patients experiencing serious low red blood cells, excessive bleeding, and an increase in infections. This disorder can be life threatening and in some cases it can progress to leukemia. The disease is most often seen in patients greater than 60 and is more common in men. The following conditions increase the risk of this disorder: previous treatment for cancer, a family history of the disease, smoking, and exposure to certain chemicals.","124":"Parotitis is an inflammation of the parotid glands. These are two large salivary glands. One of the glands is in front of each ear. Either one or both parotid glands can be inflamed. Possible causes include a bacterial infection, a viral infection, a stone in the parotid gland, a tumor, an autoimmune disease or other medical conditions.","1240":"The disease is caused by the Bartonella bacteria and is transmitted to humans from cats by a scratch, bite or open skin exposure to cat saliva. About 2 weeks after becoming infected symptoms of lymph node swelling (lymphadenopathy) occurs. A fever and general fatigue begin before the swelling. The disease  will often go away without treatment; but it can become very serious in those with a weakened immune system.","1241":"Thrush (candidiasis) is a fungal infection in the mouth. It is caused by yeasts belonging to the genus Candida. An overgrowth of yeast causes white patches on the corners of the mouth, the insides of the cheeks, the tongue, roof of the mouth and throat. It is common in babies and can be acquired during delivery. Older children, adults, or the elderly are more likely to get thrush if they are diabetic, malnourished, wearing dentures, or receiving treatment with corticosteroids (prednisone), antibiotics, or cancer chemotherapy","1242":"An infection or inflammation of the meninges. The meninges cover the brain and spinal cord. A fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is contained within the meninges in an area named the subarachnoid space. Infections of the CSF are the most common cause of meningitis and these infections can be caused by viruses, bacteria, or fungi. Viruses are the most common cause of this disorder and in general are not as serious as the other causes. If left untreated meningitis can lead to loss of hearing, brain damage and death. This disease can arise from an infection of the blood, or from an adjacent infection such as an infection of the ear, sinuses or nose. Meningitis is most commonly spread through the exchange of saliva or mucus. It is not spread through casual contact or by breathing in air where an infected person has been.  ","1243":"A disease that causes a low number of platelets (thrombocytopenia). Platelets are essential for normal blood clotting and are made in the bone marrow. Most people have more than 150,000 platelets per microliter. Serious bleeding is usually seen when the count drops below 10,000. In ITP the body's immune system attacks and destroys the platelets. The disease can occur in children and adults. In children, it may be triggered by  a viral infection. The disorder often resolves in children but can be long lasting (chronic) in adults.","1244":"Damage to the skin caused by too much exposure to the sun. Ultraviolet rays from the sun burn the skin. Sunburn occurs whenever people engage in outdoor activities without appropriate protection either with clothing and\/or sun blocking agents such as suntan lotions. For best prevention one should use a lotion with an SPF (sun protection factor) of 30 - 50. A sunburn can also occur from improper use of tanning beds. A severe sunburn can become sun poisoning, which is a potentially life threatening reaction to the sun damage. ","1245":"An ulcer (erosion) occurs in the rectum, usually producing rectal bleeding with straining, and with bowel movements. Most ulcers are solitary, but rarely multiple ulcers can be found. The disorder is not well understood and rare.","1246":"Chlorine bleach (household bleach), used to whiten fabrics or remove mold from surfaces, is a 3 to 6% solution of a stabilized form of chlorine. When bleach is mixed with ammonia a toxic gas (chloramine) is released. Chlorine ingestion can cause a burn to the esophageal and gastrointestinal tissues; however, household formulations rarely cause significant injury.","1247":"An infection of the upper airway that usually lasts 2-4 days. Patients often experience low grade fevers, fatigue, nasal congestion or runny nose and a dry cough. Almost always caused by a virus. There are many viruses that cause this infection and they are contagious.","1248":"Occurs in the extremities, with the lower leg being the most common site. Swelling in an enclosed space of a limb (called a compartment) causes increased pressure and decreased blood flow leading to damage to the tissues. This can result in the death of muscles and nerves. If left untreated, complete paralysis of the affected limb and\/or gangrene can develop requiring amputation.","1249":"A change in awareness of a person's surroundings and\/or impaired mental functioning. Also known as altered mental status. Treatable causes include: infection, adverse drug reaction, very high or very low blood sugar, low oxygen level, a blood electrolyte imbalance. ","125":"Amyloidosis is a disease that is caused by the deposit of an abnormal protein called amyloid. The protein can deposit in tissue and organs throughout the body. Symptoms are related to the organs involved. The cause of primary amyloidosis is unknown, but it can be seen in patients with multiple myeloma. Amyloidosis can occasionally result from certain chronic inflammatory diseases, such as persistent infections and rheumatoid arthritis. This is called secondary amyloidosis.","1250":"Sever\u2019s Disease (Calcaneal Apophysitis) is a painful foot condition that most commonly affects children between 8 and 15 years of age. The disorder affects the growth plate of the heel and occurs because the bone grows faster than the muscles and tendons. This unequal growth causes the muscles and tendons to become tight causing heel pain during weight bearing activities. Severs disease is most common in active girls aged 8-10, and active boys 10-12. ","1251":"A laceration (cut) of the skin. The injury can involve only the skin, or the underlying tendons, nerves or blood vessels.","1252":"A fast growing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It was first reported in African children. In the more common types seen in the U.S., the cancer usually starts in the belly area (abdomen). ","1253":"A benign tumor of the eighth cranial nerve. The eighth cranial nerve connects the brain to the middle ear and is involved in controlling balance and hearing. These tumors usually grow very slowly. They occur most often between 30 and 60 years of age. Left untreated these tumors can cause permanent hearing loss.","1254":"The mitral valve separates the upper and lower chambers on the left side of the heart (left atrium and left ventricle). When the valve opens, blood flows from the left atrium to the left ventricle. When it closes, it prevents blood from flowing backward. In mitral regurgitation the blood flows backward into the atrium when the ventricle contracts. This backward flow causes enlargement of the left atrium and increased pressure in the lungs. The enlargement of the left atrium can cause an abnormal rhythm of the heart called atrial fibrillation. The increased pressure in the lungs can cause shortness of breath. The most common causes of mitral regurgitation include: mitral valve prolapse, infection of the valve (endocarditis), damage to the valve from a heart attack, rheumatic fever, wear and tear of the valve, untreated high blood pressure, and congenital heart disease.","1255":"Botulism is a rare and potentially lethal condition. The symptoms are caused by a toxin produced by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum. There are three types of this disease: wound botulism, food-related botulism and infantile botulism. The infantile form is the most common and is seen between the ages of 2 and 6 months. Food-related botulism occurs when a patient eats food contaminated with the bacteria and toxin. The wound type is the result of a wound becoming infected with the bacteria. Death from this disorder occurs because the toxin can paralyze the breathing muscles.","1256":"Stuttering is a speech disorder that involves repeating or prolonging sounds, words or phrases. The individual that stutters knows what they want to say but has difficulty fluidly speaking the words. Stuttering may be present in normal speech development. Tools exist to predict whether stuttering is likely to continue and whether therapy is necessary.","1257":"A headache refers to pain in the head or upper neck. It ranks among the most common local pain complaints and may be frequent for many people. Headaches can be caused by many things including tension, trauma, caffeine withdrawal, life threatening bleeding, or migraines. Rarely, headaches are due to brain tumors or a serious infection (such as meningitis)  Often, the cause is unknown.","1258":"A rare disorder that causes too much urine to be produced because the kidneys are not able to absorb the correct amount of water as the blood is being filtered. The hypothalamus in the brain produces a hormone called ADH (antidiuretic hormone) which is stored in the pituitary gland. ADH normally causes the kidneys to absorb water from the urine before it leaves the kidneys and enters the bladder. Diabetes insipidus is caused by a failure of the hypothalamus to produce ADH (central diabetes insipidus) or by a failure of the kidneys to react normally to ADH (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). This disorder can cause dehydration or abnormalities of the blood chemistry (electrolytes). Diabetes insipidus is not related to the more common diabetes that causes elevated blood sugar (glucose) levels (diabetes mellitus). ","1259":"A condition associated with pregnancy in which the flow of bile from the gallbladder to the small intestine is slowed or blocked. This disorder usually occurs in the third trimester of pregnancy. The disease is not dangerous for the mother but can be harmful for the unborn baby. The following conditions increase the risk of this disorder: family history of the disorder, carrying multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets etc.), and prior liver damage in the pregnant woman. ","126":"An allergy is an abnormal response of the immune system of the body to some type of foreign substance. The substance that triggers the allergic reaction is called an allergen. Initial contact with the allergen does not produce any symptoms. However, with time the immune system begins to form antibodies to the allergen. Future interactions with the allergen trigger more dramatic responses. The response to these sensitizing allergens varies from mild sneezing to respiratory difficulty, shock, and death.","1260":"An absence seizure (petit mal) is related to an abnormal discharge of electricity in the brain. Normally, electrical signals in the brain flow in regular controlled pathways. In an absence seizure, the normal electrical pathways are disrupted, resulting in an abnormal discharge of electricity throughout the brain. This discharge results in a brief loss of consciousness, usually less than thirty seconds. During these episodes, the individual may appear dazed and unresponsive. The cause of the seizures is unknown in most cases but can be related to previous head trauma and infections such as meningitis and encephalitis. Symptoms usually begin between the ages of four and fifteen.","1261":"Encopresis is fecal soiling that occurs sometime after a child is toilet trained, usually in children older than 4. The most common cause is a resistance to have a bowel movement. With time stool backs up in the large intestine and rectum and can become lodged (impacted) in the lower part of the colon or rectum. The impaction is painful to pass. The child becomes constipated and reluctant to use the bathroom. The child then experiences involuntary passage of liquid stool around the blockage which stains the underwear. Emotional and psychological factors may contribute to the problem.","1262":"A mucocele is a soft swelling in the mouth that occurs when a salivary gland is injured or blocked. The area is the same color as the surrounding tissue. It occurs in about 1 out of 500 adults. These swellings commonly occur inside the lower lip. They can also occur in the roof or floor of the mouth. Trauma is the leading cause.","1263":"A reaction to medications that have serotonin activity. Serotonin is a brain hormone also known as a \"neurotransmitter\". The reaction known as serotonin syndrome occurs when too much of certain medications are taken. These medications include: antidepressants, triptans for migraines, pain medications, anti-nausea medications, lithium, over-the-counter cold medications. Patients can experience restlessness, rapid heartbeat, fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and seizures","1264":"Mucus accumulation in the back of the nose and throat leading to mucus dripping down the back of the nose and down the throat. Post-nasal drip may lead to chronic sore throat or chronic cough. Chronic sinusitis or any conditions that cause excessive thick secretions can lead to this disorder.","1265":"A life-threatening allergic reaction involving a rash with skin breakdown. Steven Johnson syndrome involves very serious inflammation of the skin and mucous membranes and requires aggressive treatment and hospitalization. The skin becomes red, and blisters and sloughs after dying. Steven-Johnson is an extension of a rash known as erythema multiforme. The disorder is usually an allergic reaction to medications or infections. The most common medications involved are sulfa drugs, tetracycline, amoxicillin, ampicillin, anti-seizure medications, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\/NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) and allopurinol. ","1266":"An inflammatory disease of the lungs characterized by reversible airway obstruction. The tubes that carry air in the lungs are called bronchi and bronchioles. In asthma these tubes become narrowed because of abnormal muscular contraction of the tubes and from inflammation. The lining of these tubes become irritated and secrete mucous and white blood cells into the airways, making the narrowing worse. In some patients this narrowing occurs in response to an irritant such as cold air, dust, pollen, exercise, or tobacco smoke. The severity of symptoms varies greatly among patients.","1267":"Most pesticides are organophosphates. Symptoms involve excessive secretions and muscle weakness. If untreated a large exposure can be rapidly fatal due to respiratory failure.\r\n\r\nFor more information and help call your local poison center at 1-800-222-1222.","1268":"Developmental delay occurs when a child does not meet their expected developmental milestones. These milestones refer to motor function, brain function and social skills. There are a variety of causes of developmental delay including prematurity, infections and genetic causes.","1269":"Neutropenia is an abnormally low number of white blood cells called neutrophils, also known as granulocytes. Decreased numbers of neutrophils result in an increased risk of infection for the affected individuals. Neutropenia is defined as less than 1500 neutrophils per microliter. It is seen most often in people receiving chemotherapy. It\u2019s also a rare side effect of many other types of drugs. Some infections also cause neutropenia. When caused by a drug or infection, the neutrophils almost always go back up when the drug is stopped or infection resolves. There are some rare inherited disorders that cause neutropenia. ","127":"A hearing impairment or hearing loss is a full or partial decrease in the ability to hear. It can be the result of a wide range of biological and environmental factors. It commonly occurs with aging. ","1270":"Oral ulcers are \"pits\" or eroded areas on the inside surface of the gums or cheeks. Oral ulcers are also called \"aphthous\" ulcers. Some people get oral ulcers without having a known reason. They can also be caused by a virus (such as herpes simplex virus, or Coxsackie virus which is common in children). Occasionally an ulcer is actually a cancer. Friction from a tooth edge\/dental implant or an autoimmune disorder may explain ulcers that are persistent or severe.","1271":"Acute infections of the urinary tract can be separated into upper and lower tract infections. The bladder is the most common site of all infections (cystitis). It is a lower tract infection. Upper tract infections involve the ureters and kidneys. Kidney infections (pyelonephritis) can be very serious with high fever, vomiting, and severe pain. Because of the shorter urethras in women they are more prone to develop urinary tract infections than men. Most urinary tract infections are caused by bacteria. Catheterization of the bladder increases the risk of the infection. In patients with a weakened immune system (diabetics, patients receiving chemotherapy, HIV\/AIDS, elderly) prompt treatment is needed because of the increased chance of a life threatening infection developing.","1272":"LSD, also called acid, is a street drug taken for its hallucinogenic effects. LSD is produced and sold in the following forms: liquid, blotter paper, sugar cubes, gelatin squares, and tablets. Frequent users of LSD may have flashbacks (certain aspects of the LSD experience recur). Users are at increased risk of anxiety, depression, and\/or psychosis.","1273":"Trichomonas vaginalis is a type of protozoa that affects the genitourinary tract. It commonly leads to infections of the vagina causing inflammation known as vaginitis. It is often spread through sexual contact. Men can become infected as well. Both sexual partners need to be treated to eradicate the infection.","1274":"A bacterial infection caused by the bacteria Bacillus anthracis. The anthrax bacteria are most often found in farm animals. Infections usually involve people who work with animals. There are three different forms of the disease. The cutaneous form occurs after the bacteria get into an open skin sore. The inhalation type occurs after breathing in the bacteria and causes a life threatening lung infection (pneumonia). The last form occurs when patients swallow the bacteria causing an infection of the intestinal tract. ","1275":"A type of anxiety defined by obsessions (recurrent, intrusive thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive, ritualistic behaviors). It usually begins in childhood or adolescence, and is somewhat common during and following pregnancy. OCD symptoms fluctuate throughout life, but rarely go completely away. ","1276":"Caused by blood in the tympanic cavity of the middle ear (behind the ear drum) and is often the result of a basilar skull fracture.","1277":"A condition that develops when the blood lacks enough red blood cells. These cells are the main transporters of oxygen to organs. There are three main causes of anemia: blood loss, destruction of blood cells in the body, or abnormal production of red blood cells. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia. Other disorders associated with anemia include vitamin deficiencies, sickle cell disease, cancer, and many chronic conditions (known as anemia of chronic disease). ","1278":"This disorder occurs when the glucose level in the blood becomes very high, at times over 1000 mg\/dl. This disorder is usually seen in Type 2 diabetics. The disease is very serious and up to 15% of those afflicted can die. People are very dehydrated and can have dangerously low blood pressures. The condition may be triggered by an infection or silent heart attack. The disorder can occur at any age but is most commonly seen in older people with an average age of 70. The very high glucose level may be the first sign of diabetes. Patients need immediate treatment.","1279":"An inherited disease that affects the connective tissue of the body. Connective tissue is found throughout the body including the eyes, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, heart and other organs. The connective tissue loses its normal elastic properties and becomes weak. This defect in the connective tissue results in weakening of the heart valves, enlargement of the aorta (aortic aneurysm), tearing of the aorta (aortic dissection), dislocation of the lens of the eye, glaucoma, emphysema, collapsed lung (pneumothorax), skeletal deformities, and complications during pregnancy. The gene is dominant, meaning a child has a 50% chance of getting Marfan syndrome if one parent has the disorder. People with Marfan syndrome are typically tall and thin with long arms and legs. ","128":"A recurrent inflammatory disease affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Sections of the intestinal tract most commonly affected include the lower part of the small intestine (ileum) and the large intestine (colon); however, any part of the digestive tract, from mouth to rectum, may be involved. It is an autoimmune disease and is most common in people between the ages of 15 and 35. Other risk factors are a family history of Crohn's disease, Jewish ancestry and smoking.","1280":"Methanol is found in canned heating sources (e.g. STERNO), antifreeze, windshield wiper fluid, fuel additives, and paint removers. Ingestion can be intentional or accidental. Methanol is converted into toxic metabolites that can cause blindness, confusion, and gastrointestinal symptoms. If left untreated it can be deadly.","1281":"The spine consists of bones (the vertebrae) separated by gelatinous cushions (the discs). The discs are held in place with ligaments. When these ligaments tear, the discs may protrude between the vertebrae. These protruded discs can push on spinal nerves, causing severe pain in the back, arm or leg served by these nerves. At times the protrusion can cause permanent damage to the nerves and requires emergent surgical repair.","1282":"Cat bites are especially prone to become infected. The cats\u2019 teeth can penetrate deeply into the tissue, and bacteria from the cat's mouth and saliva can enter the wound. The most common kind of bacteria to infect a cat bite is Pasturella multocida.","1283":"A skin condition, commonly caused by an allergic reaction, that is characterized by raised red skin wheals (welts) lasting hours to a day or two. Urticaria most commonly results from cold, allergies, or stress.","1284":"Yeast is a kind of microbe called a fungus. Yeast commonly infects the vaginal area. The most common organism is Candida albicans. These infections are more common after taking an antibiotic. The antibiotic kills the normal bacteria that live in the vagina, allowing the fungus to grow without any competition.","1285":"Small growths develop on the penis or on the foreskin and continue to grow. Cancer of the penis is an uncommon disorder. It is more likely to occur in men who have not undergone circumcision and those infected with human papilloma virus (HPV). The growths become painful or bleed. Cancer of the penis is more common in men over age 50.","1286":"An inflammation of the adenoid tissue (lymph node tissue) in the back of the nose and throat. The most common cause of the inflammation is an infection. Infections can be caused by bacteria such as group A streptococcus (strep) or a virus such as infectious mononucleosis (mono). Viral infections do not respond to antibiotics and are treated symptomatically.","1287":"In placenta previa the placenta covers the cervix (the baby's exit from the uterus). Normally, the placenta is attached away from the cervix. Most pregnancies that begin with placenta previa resolve the problem without treatment--the growth of the uterus shifts the position of the placenta away from the cervix. With placenta previa, bleeding from the placenta can occur. This can threaten the life of the fetus and the mother. Placenta previa is more common in older mothers, mothers with previous cesarean sections and in women with multiple previous childbirths.","1288":"Not a true allergic reaction. Instead, anaphylactoid reactions are caused by the direct release of the same substances that cause allergic reactions. The  symptoms range from a rash to life threatening anaphylaxis. Intravenous contrast dye and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen are two well-described causes.","1289":"Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is the growth of abnormal immature white blood cells in the bone marrow. The bone marrow is the soft spongy material contained in the center of the bones. There are several types of white blood cells normally produced by the bone marrow. These include neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes and monocytes. The normal marrow production is replaced by production of immature lymphocytes called blasts. This over-growth of cells prevents the production of normal blood cells. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) most often occurs in children and teens.   ","129":"Abrasion and erosion are two types of damage to the tooth's outer covering, the enamel. Sometimes they also affect deeper parts of the tooth. Tooth abrasion is caused by rubbing or scraping against the teeth. Brushing too hard is a common cause. Using toothpicks can cause abrasion. So can removing and replacing partial dentures or retainers. Chemicals such as acids cause tooth erosion. Usually the acids are in foods or drinks, such as citrus fruits, soda (regular or diet) and some fruit juices. Acid reflux and frequent vomiting, as in bulimia, also can cause tooth erosion.","1290":"Mesenteric adenitis is inflammation and swelling of the lymph nodes next to the intestines. The swollen lymph nodes may result in abdominal pain and mimic symptoms of appendicitis. The condition can occur in adults but is more common in adolescents and young adults. The condition is generally not dangerous and resolves on its own. ","1291":"An upper leg fracture is a fracture of the thigh bone called the femur. The femur is a strong bone and it takes a tremendous amount of force to break the bone. The most common causes of fracture are a fall from height, car accidents, and in individuals with osteoporotic bone. Treatment depends on the location, severity of the injury and age of the patient. The fracture can damage adjacent nerves and blood vessels. Fractures of this area can bleed a great deal and can be life threatening. ","1292":"Toenail fungus (onychomycosis) is the growth of fungus on the nails of the foot. The big and little toes are most often affected. Certain factors increase the risk of development of toenail fungus. These include tight-fitting shoes, athletic participation, poor hygiene, poor circulation, HIV and diabetes. ","1293":"The buildup of plaque in the walls of arteries (atherosclerosis) is the cause of peripheral vascular disease (more often called peripheral artery disease). The condition most often refers to one or more narrowed arteries in the legs. During exercise a narrowed vessel is unable to provide adequate blood flow to the muscles causing pain and weakness. The symptoms are relieved by rest.","1294":"A mental state or chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by excessive feelings of sadness, loneliness, despair, helplessness, low self-esteem, and self-reproach. Depression is different than normal sadness because it prevents the person from functioning normally in their daily life. Other signs of depression include a lack of energy or initiative (psychomotor retardation), agitation, withdrawal from social contact, insomnia, decreased appetite and\/or a vegetative state. The symptoms can become severe enough to cause self-harm or suicide. Any patient having thoughts their life is not worth living needs to get immediate professional help.","1295":"Bell's palsy is a weakness of the muscles on one side of the face. It is caused by inflammation, swelling and abnormal function of the facial nerve, which leads to weakness of the muscles on one side of the face. Often the cause is unknown, but it commonly begins with a viral infection. Less common causes of Bell's palsy are Lyme disease, ear infection (otitis media), HIV infection and brain tumors. People of any age can develop Bell\u2019s palsy.  The majority of patients have a full recovery in 3 to 6 months. Sometimes the symptoms come back. Rarely, the weakness persists for life.","1296":"A rare, but potentially life-threatening, disorder that causes inflammation of small and medium sized arteries. Blood supply to affected organs is slowed and this results in damage. Polyarteritis nodosa most commonly affects kidneys, nerves of the arms and legs, and the abdominal organs (bowel, liver, pancreas). Less commonly, the skin, heart, eyes, muscles, brain and reproductive organs can be affected. The average age of onset is 45 years and men are affected twice as often as women. PAN can be associated with chronic hepatitis B infection.","1297":"Pain in the lower back and hip radiating down the back of the thigh into the leg. The pain usually increases with flexion at the hip. Patients also experience numbness and occasionally weakness in the leg. The disorder can be caused by irritation of the sciatic nerve (irritants may be released from a ruptured disc in the back), by a pulled muscle injury, or by a herniated lumbar disc compressing a nerve root, most commonly the L5 or S1 root.","1298":"Twisting of the testicle in the scrotum. The testicles are suspended from the spermatic cords. These cords supply the nerves and blood vessels to the testicles. Normally the testicles are attached to the sides of the scrotum preventing twisting. At times these attachments are not present allowing the testicle to twist in the scrotum causing the vessels in the spermatic cord to become blocked. If the twisting is not relieved the testicle can die. It is most common in adolescents (12 to 20 years), but can affect all ages.","1299":"A bursa is a sac of clear fluid and part of a joint that allows the tendons to move more easily over and between the bones of the joint. The greater trochanteric bursa lies over the hip joint. Bursitis is inflammation of the bursa. It can occur without any identifiable reason. Other causes include trauma, arthritis, and infection. ","13":"An irritation, inflammation, erosion or infection of the stomach lining. It can be acute or chronic. Gastritis can be present with either a gastric erosion or gastric ulcer. An infection with the bacteria Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) can increase the incidence and severity of the disease. The following conditions increase the risk of this disorder: drinking alcohol, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \/ NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin), smoking, and serious illness or stress (such as an infection or trauma).","130":"A common skin condition characterized by whiteheads, blackheads, and inflamed red pimples or \"zits.\" It occurs most commonly on the face and back. Acne often becomes worse during puberty when there is an increase in the secretion of the hormones called androgens. Severe acne can cause permanent scarring. ","1300":"A temporary condition of the heart that occurs after a stressful event such as the death of a loved one. It is thought to occur because of a release of adrenalin (epinephrine) associated with the event. People can experience chest pain, breathing problems, irregular beating of the heart, or fluid buildup in the lungs. The symptoms can mimic a heart attack.","1301":"Disorder characterized by physical symptoms with no known or detectable physical basis. It is a condition thought to be psychogenic (psychological) in nature. Examples include certain cases of: chronic abdominal pain, low back pain, chronic fatigue, chronic chest pain, and chronic headaches.","1302":"A disease caused by the parasite, Leishmania. Infection is transmitted to humans through the bite of a sand fly. There are two forms: a cutaneous form involving the skin and mucous membranes, and a visceral form involving the entire body. The visceral form can be deadly. The parasite is found in every continent except Australia and Antarctica. In the Americas, leishmaniasis can be found in Mexico and South America. ","1303":"Methanol is found in wood alcohol, canned heating sources, antifreeze, windshield wiper fluid, fuel additives, and paint removers. Ingestion of materials containing methanol can be intentional or accidental. Methanol is converted into toxic metabolites that can cause blindness, confusion, and gastrointestinal symptoms. If left untreated it can be deadly.","1304":"Mycosis fungoides is a rare form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that results in red patches and lesions on the skin. It is more likely to occur in men, adults over the age of 45, and darker skinned people. ","1305":"Dyslipidemia means you have an abnormal cholesterol profile, usually a high LDL cholesterol level. Elevated levels of LDL cholesterol in the blood increase the risk of having narrowed arteries. The blockage is caused by a buildup of fat deposits called plaque (atherosclerosis). The diseases caused by this narrowing are dependent on the arteries being blocked but include: angina, heart attacks, strokes, and peripheral vascular disease. People having elevated cholesterol are more likely to also have high blood pressure and diabetes. There are two types of cholesterol that make up the total level of cholesterol, LDL and HDL. LDL is considered bad cholesterol and HDL is good cholesterol. The most important number is the LDL cholesterol level. The ideal level is based on the person\u2019s individual risk of heart disease and stroke. A person\u2019s cholesterol profile is determined in part by inheritance, and in part by the foods he or she eats. ","1306":"A contagious viral infection with mild symptoms associated with a characteristic rash. The disease is almost unheard of in the U.S. because the MMR (Measles\/Mumps\/Rubella) vaccine given to children prevents the disease. The disease is most serious for pregnant women who develop the infection in their first trimester, and have not received the vaccine. 80% of fetuses exposed to rubella in the first 11 weeks of gestation experience rubella congenital syndrome. Rubella congenital syndrome consists of growth retardation, cataracts, deafness, heart defects, mental retardation and fetal death. Rubella was once was known as German measles.","1307":"A rare disorder that results in little to no production of parathyroid hormone. Parathyroid hormone, along with vitamin D and calcitonin, is responsible for the regulation of blood calcium levels. Without enough parathyroid hormone, the calcium blood level will be low. This can cause muscle spasms and increase the risk of seizures. Hypoparathyroidism can be present at birth (congenital) or happen later in life (acquired), such as after total removal of the thyroid gland. ","131":"A condition of low thyroid hormone. The thyroid gland is located in the front of the neck. Thyroid hormone helps control metabolism. Low thyroid hormone is caused by abnormalities of the thyroid gland, pituitary gland, or hypothalamus. For people who take thyroid hormone medication, hypothyroidism may be due to an insufficient dose. Low thyroid hormone can affect all bodily functions and if severe may cause coma (myxedema) and death.","132":"A weakened portion of the abdominal aorta that expands. The abdominal aorta is the large artery in the abdomen that carries blood to the abdomen and legs. This weakened section can continue to expand, dissect, or rupture. A rupture of the aneurysm is a life threatening condition, leading to rapid blood loss and if left untreated death. A dissection of the aorta is a separation of the layers of the aorta and can occlude blood vessels to the abdominal organs (intestines, kidneys, etc.) and legs.","133":"Chest pain that is caused by insufficient blood supply through the coronary arteries that feed oxygen and nutrients to the heart. Stable angina is pain that occurs with a fixed amount of exercise. Unstable angina is pain that now occurs with less exertion or at rest. The disorder is very serious since it is a warning sign of an imminent heart attack. This is a medical emergency. Untreated it can lead to rapid death.","134":"Mycoplasma is a unique type of bacteria that is extremely small and, similar to a virus, lacks a cell wall. The bacteria can cause a sore throat, ear infection and can involve the lungs (pneumonia). Spread of infection is usually through close person-to-person contact. Symptoms usually start 10 to 14 days after contact and may be prolonged, lasting several weeks. Infections can occur at any time of year. ","135":"A fracture is a broken bone. The scaphoid is a bone in the hand at the base of the thumb which links the wrist to the hand. A scaphoid fracture is not always seen on x-ray. If the patient has tenderness at the base of thumb in an area called the anatomic snuff box many times the medical provider will splint the wrist and thumb as if it was fractured. Sometimes surgery is needed to realign the bones and to place a screw or wire to stabilize the bones while they heal. Severe fractures may have an associated tendon, nerve or blood vessel injury. ","136":"A virus that causes painful blisters on the skin and the mucus membranes. They occur around the mouth, lips and the genitals. Herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-type 1) commonly causes oral sores like fever blisters on the mouth or face (oral herpes). HSV-type 2 typically affects the genital area (genital herpes). Once infected, the blisters may heal but the virus may remain dormant within the nerve cells. The sores of HSV may return when a person is experiencing emotional or physical stress or immune suppression.  However, attacks of herpes may recur for no identifiable reason. The virus is very contagious and spreads from physical contact such as kissing or sexual intercourse.","137":"An Arnold Chiari malformation is an abnormality of the brain. In this disorder, the skull surrounding the back of the brain (cerebellum) is small and this pushes a portion of the brain (cerebellar tonsils) down through the hole between the brain and the spinal column (foramen magnum). The fluid around the brain (CSF) normally flows through this hole and down to the spinal column. An Arnold Chiari malformation can result in an obstruction of this flow called hydrocephalus. Arnold Chiari malformations are thought to be present at birth although they may not cause symptoms until later in life. The cause of the malformations is unknown.","138":"A blockage of bile flow can cause bacterial infection and inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis) or the ducts (cholangitis). The bile ducts carry bile from the liver to the gall bladder and then to the small intestine. The most common cause of bile blockage is gallstones. Another cause of cholecystitis is a non-functioning gallbladder. Cholecystitis from a non-functioning gallbladder is called acalculous cholecystitis. This disease can be very serious and lead to death if left untreated.","139":"Characterized by an inflammation of the bladder wall with symptoms similar to those of a urinary tract infection. The range of symptoms can be mild to severe and debilitating. Women ages 30 to 40 are most commonly affected. The cause of this disorder is unknown.","14":"The plantar fascia is a fan of dense fibers that is attached to the bottom of the heel bone (calcaneus) and extends forward along the bottom of the foot. The plantar fascia can become irritated where it joins to the heel bone. This causes pain and tenderness. The symptoms can make walking painful and are usually worse in the morning.","140":"A fracture is a broken bone. The toes are commonly fractured. In most cases the fracture of a toe bone can be treated just by putting a splint on it. If the broken bone punctures the skin (open fracture) antibiotics will be needed to prevent an infection of the bone (osteomyelitis). If after the fracture the pieces of the bone do not come together properly, the bones will be put back in place and splinted. Severe fractures may have an associated tendon, nerve or blood vessel injury.","141":"Lung infections will sometimes develop into a collection of pus forming an abscess. Risk factors include advanced age, poor health or nutrition, immunosuppression, and cancer. Other diseases associated with the disorder are: necrotizing pneumonia, septic emboli and aspiration pneumonia. These infections are almost always caused by bacteria. ","142":"A burning sensation of the tongue, the roof of the mouth, the gums, the inside of the cheeks and the back of the mouth or throat. There are no clinical or laboratory abnormalities found. The following conditions increase the likelihood of acquiring this disorder: type 2 diabetes, nutritional deficiencies, anxiety, and depression.","143":"Occurs when the outermost joint of the finger is injured. The injury occurs when the tendon on the back side (dorsal) of the finger detaches from the bone. It can be associated with a fracture. The patient is unable to extend the end of the finger. It is a common sports injury.","144":"Mastocytosis is caused by an abnormal growth of mast cells. Mast cells are anti-inflammatory cells made in the bone marrow. They release the chemical histamine. Histamine causes swelling, itching and redness and is one of the substances responsible for an allergic reaction. This disorder can occur at any age but is most often seen in children. Many times the disease will resolve on its own in puberty. The most common site for the increased number of mast cells is in the skin although other areas such as the intestines can be affected. The symptoms are caused by a trigger such as exposure to cold or heat, certain medications, insect stings, or emotional stress. Symptoms can be isolated to the skin or can involve the entire body and at times be life threatening.","145":"The carotid arteries carry blood from the heart to the brain. Blockages typically occur from atherosclerosis but congenital abnormalities and trauma can result in narrowing of the arteries (stenosis). A stroke can occur if the narrowing suddenly becomes blocked with a clot or a piece of plaque lining the inside of the artery) breaks off and blocks an artery inside the brain.","146":"Lacerations of the toe can be simple involving only the skin or complex with injury to tendons, nerves and\/or blood vessels. With tendon lacerations there is weakness of the toe, and with nerve damage, numbness is experienced beyond the laceration.","147":"Cutaneous T cell lymphoma includes a group of rare cancers that involve the skin. In these cancers, white blood cells attack the skin causing a variety of skin lesions. The most common forms of cutaneous T cell lymphoma are mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome. Cutaneous T cell lymphoma is more common in men and individuals with a sub-Saharan African heritage. ","148":"An inherited kidney disease that causes multiple cysts to form in both kidneys.  Cysts are noncancerous round sacs containing water-like fluid. Most affected people have high blood pressure. The most serious consequence of the disease is kidney failure. Some patients have increased risk of developing cerebral aneurysms.","149":"A contagious, sexually-transmitted infection caused by the bacteria, Treponema pallidum. Doctors define the infection according to one of three stages. The first stage, primary syphilis, infects the genitalia. It classically causes a painless sore and may not be noticed by the individual. The secondary stage causes fever, rash, and joint pain. The tertiary stage may cause severe brain and heart injury. The damage may not be reversible, despite adequate antibiotic therapy.","15":"Caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant, and temporarily wards off drowsiness. Beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee, tea, soft drinks and energy drinks enjoy great popularity. Caffeine is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive substance. In North America, 90% of adults consume caffeine daily.","150":"Bleeding into the brain. It often occurs in people with uncontrolled high blood pressure. Other causes include trauma, aneurysms, blood clotting disorders, or brain tumors (either primary or from metastasis).","151":"A medical emergency where the adrenal gland does not make enough of the hormone cortisol. Cortisol is essential and helps maintain blood pressure, normal heart function, glucose metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, protein metabolism, fat metabolism, and normal emotional well-being. The adrenal gland is located on top of the kidneys in the abdomen. Adrenal crisis occurs when patients with Addison's disease become stressed such as with an infection, after an injury, or during a surgery. There are two types of Addison's disease (adrenal insufficiency), primary and secondary. In primary the adrenal gland is damaged usually from an autoimmune disease, other causes include infections, cancer and bleeding into the gland. Secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs when the pituitary gland in the brain does not produce enough adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH tells the adrenal gland to produce cortisol. In secondary adrenal insufficiency the adrenal gland itself is normal. The most common cause of secondary disease is taking steroids. Any other problem that damages the pituitary gland such as cancer, infection or surgery can also cause the secondary form of the disease.","152":"A rare disease of the muscle of the esophagus. The esophagus is the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. Achalasia occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter fails to relax and let food pass into the stomach. The cause of the disorder is unknown, and is more common in older patients.","153":"A type of dementia that causes loss of normal brain function. Lewy body dementia is the second most common cause of dementia second only to Alzheimer's disease. This disorder has cognitive deficiencies similar to those in Alzheimer's and movement problems similar to those Parkinson's disease. This can make confirming the diagnosis difficult early in the patient's course. Some patients develop the memory problems first while others suffer the movement symptoms first. Most patients also demonstrate hallucinations, difficulties sleeping and troubles with behavior. The disease name originates from the characteristic microscopic Lewy bodies found in the brain at autopsy.","154":"A stab wound to the ankle. These wounds can damage structures deep to the skin such as blood vessels, nerves, or tendons. The object that caused the wound can carry bacteria or foreign material deep into the wound and cause infections. Puncture wounds from animal or human bites are especially prone to infections. ","155":"A generalized seizure is related to an abnormal discharge of electricity in the brain. Normally, electrical signals in the brain flow in regular controlled pathways. In a generalized seizure, there is electrical discharge deep in the brain that spreads to involve the entire brain. Attacks begin with a loss of consciousness and may progress to violent jerking or rigidity. This disorder is also called a tonic clonic seizure and in the past was called a grand mal seizure.","156":"Occurs in patients with sickle cell disease when sickled red blood cells clog blood vessels. Sickle cell disease is the most common of the inherited blood disorders, and is seen primarily in black Americans and black Africans. A sickle cell crisis causes pain because blood vessels become blocked by the defective red blood cells, which can damage organs in the body. The most commonly affected organs include: lungs, liver, bone, muscles, brain, spleen, penis, eyes, and kidneys. ","157":"Blepharitis affects the skin of the eyelids, and it usually involves the lid margins. It occurs when tiny oil glands located near the base of the eyelashes malfunction allowing bacterial overgrowth to occur. The eyelids become inflamed, irritated and itchy.","158":"Occurs when an infection, usually bacterial, causes severe systemic (whole body) illness. Bacteria types that can cause sepsis typically produce chemical toxins. Sepsis causes the blood vessels to dilate (go into shock). Sepsis can worsen so that it results in severe damage to multiple organs. Unfortunately even with treatment the disorder is frequently fatal. Almost any infection can result in sepsis although the most common are pneumonia (lung infection), urinary tract infection (bladder infection), and cellulitis (skin infection). Patients with weakened immune systems are at the greatest risk of this disorder. These patients include: diabetics, patients on chemotherapy, HIV patients, patients taken powerful medications for auto immune diseases, infants, elderly patients, and patients with chronic diseases. ","159":"A defect in the skin of the lip caused by trauma. If the laceration crosses the junction between the lighter skin and the redder tissue (vermillion border) the laceration must be repaired carefully. Noticeable disfigurement may occur if the edges of the vermillion border are not accurately approximated.","16":"Hemorrhage during pregnancy may be caused by many things, including injury to the uterus, bleeding from retention of the placenta, clotting disorders, toxemia of pregnancy (preeclampsia \/ eclampsia), placenta previa, uterine rupture, ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, molar pregnancy, or placental abruption. It may be life threatening for the mother and unborn baby.","160":"Chickenpox is a viral disease caused by the herpes varicella virus. It is very contagious and was much more common before the chickenpox vaccine became available. In most cases it is a mild disease but can be very serious in the very young, those with weakened immune systems, pregnant women, people with eczema, and older adults. Rarely, the infection can cause pneumonia or inflammation in the brain (encephalitis). Those patients at increased risk need to avoid exposure to anyone suspected of having chicken pox. The virus is spread by respiratory droplets that are released into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can also be spread through direct contact with chickenpox blisters. A person with chickenpox can spread the disease from 1 to 2 days before they develop a rash up until all of their blisters are scabbed over. Once someone has chickenpox, the virus remains dormant in the body and can reactivate later in life as shingles. ","161":"Inflammation of the optic nerve, the bundle of nerve fibers in the eye that transmits visual information to your brain. The cause is usually an autoimmune disorder or multiple sclerosis. ","162":"A strain or rupture of the ligament between the clavicle (collar bone) and the shoulder. The injury is graded according to severity. The highest grade indicates most damage to the ligament and the surrounding structures. The most common way of injuring the ligament is falling on the shoulder, elbow, or onto an outstretched hand.","163":"Pubic lice are small six-legged insects that generally infect the pubic region and lay eggs there. These lice can also be found in armpit hair and eyebrows. They are difficult to see without a magnifying glass, but their eggs show up as tiny bumps on hair follicles (nits). They cause intense itching and redness to the area.","164":"Lead poisoning or toxicity most commonly occurs over time. The ingested amount of lead is not cleared from the body and accumulates. The lead causes anemia, decreased IQ, abdominal pain, constipation, and kidney damage. Children are more susceptible, and exposure is often from old peeling paint or old water pipes containing lead. Other types of exposure are from hobbies and toys. In adults, exposure may occur among those who hunt with lead bullets or use them regularly at a firing range.","165":"A sleep disorder that occurs most often in children.  The child suddenly awakens from sleep in a terrified state. During such an episode, the child is not fully conscious, and cannot be reasoned with. Only rarely does the child remember the event. Night terrors are most common in children aged 2-6 and affect approximately 1-6% of all children. The disorder generally resolves during the teenage years.","166":"A poisoning of the nerves of the ear by drugs or chemicals. The nerve fibers that control hearing also send balance and position information from the inner ear to the brain. Several families of drugs can result in temporary or permanent hearing loss or balance problems. These include: aminoglycoside antibiotics, high dose loop diuretics (furosemide, bumetanide), chemotherapy drugs and aspirin.","167":"A condition in which there is chronic inflammation of the muscles. It's most often caused by an autoimmune disease, such as polymyositis or dermatomyositis, or infection. HIV and other viruses, bacteria (including mycobacteria), fungi, and parasites can cause myositis.","168":"A decreased density of the bones. Osteopenia is similar to osteoporosis but the loss of bone density is not as severe. Many patients with osteopenia later develop osteoporosis, without treatment. Bone loss occurs as one becomes older, and women are more likely to suffer from this disorder. Other conditions can cause osteopenia including: poor nutrition, smoking, being thin, having a family history of osteopenia, chemotherapy, radiation treatment, medications such as corticosteroids (prednisone), decreased physical activity, alcohol consumption, being of Caucasian ancestry, and drinking cola drinks. ","169":"An infection of the base of a hair follicle. Hot tub folliculitis occurs when a patients comes in contact with the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa that can live in the water of some hot tubs. It is more common if the hot tub is made of wood or if the acidity and chlorine content of the water is not strictly controlled. The infection is sometimes worse underneath the swimsuit areas. The infection typically appears 2 days after swimming in the hot tub.","17":"The facial nerve (also called the 7th cranial nerve) carries information from the brain to the muscles in the face. When this nerve is damaged a patient experiences a facial droop, or weakness of the facial muscles on one side of the face. The most common causes of facial nerve paralysis are Bell's palsy, infection, trauma, and cancer. A stroke (cerebrovascular accident, CVA) also causes a facial droop but in this case the nerve itself is normal and the problem is the brain not sending the correct signals. Other diseases of the brain can cause a facial droop similar to a stroke and these include brain tumors, injury to the brain from trauma or surgery, and infections of the brain. ","170":"Consuming too much fluoride while the teeth are being formed can lead to fluorosis. Fluorosis causes white or brown discoloration or spots on the tooth surface. It is not a disease. It does not cause cavities. The effects can range from minor color changes to a bumpy surface on the teeth. Fluorosis does not develop after teeth have erupted into the mouth. Most cases result from young children taking fluoride supplements or swallowing fluoride toothpaste when their water is already fluoridated.","171":"A disease of the small arteries that carry oxygen-rich blood to the fingers, toes and nose. The arteries narrow when exposed to cold temperature. This decreases blood flow to the affected body part causing it to turn white and blue. The arteries then widen, blood flow returns and the area turns red and throbs. In severe cases the decreased blood flow can cause ulcers and death of the tissue. There are two types of Raynaud's: primary and secondary. Primary Raynaud's occurs without any other associated diseases. Secondary Raynaud's, also called Raynaud's phenomenon, is caused by another disease usually an auto- immune disorder such as lupus, scleroderma, or rheumatoid arthritis. The cause of primary Raynaud's is not known but it is more common in women and in people from cold climates.","172":"An abscess is a space in the body that contains pus. An abscess forms when the body is fighting a bacterial infection and there is no way for pus to drain. In the mouth, abscesses usually form in the gums next to teeth or roots of teeth. Bacteria can enter the mouth and cause an abscess through trauma, tooth decay, tooth or root fracture, or a deepened gap between teeth and gums caused by gum disease (periodontal pocket). If the abscess does not drain and is left untreated, the infection can spread to other areas of the head and neck. In this case, it becomes a serious and even life-threatening condition.","173":"A skin infection caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus. The bacteria produce a toxin that damages the skin and causes it to shed. The red and peeling skin resembles a burn giving this disorder its name. The disease most commonly affects children less than 5 years old. Fluid loss from the blisters can cause dehydration and problems with the patient's blood chemistry. Left untreated the bacteria can enter the blood stream and lead to a life threatening infection (sepsis). With the appropriate treatment full recovery is usually achieved. ","174":"Swine flu is an influenza type A virus that has been identified as the H1N1 strain that normally can only be transmitted from pigs to human. The swine flu outbreak of 2009 is a genetic combination of avian, swine and human flu. This strain can be passed from human to human. The severity of this disease varies widely, ranging from fever and cough to pneumonia and death.\r\n","175":"A tumor of the lymph nodes of the small intestine. It most often occurs in the 5th or 6th decade and is more common in men. It is associated with the following diseases, or conditions: celiac disease, Crohn's disease, autoimmune disease, HIV, organ transplant patients, and patients on chemotherapy.","176":"Nerves can be injured during blunt trauma (MVA, fall) or penetrating trauma (gunshot wound, stab wound). If the nerve is only stunned it is called a neuropraxia, and full recovery can be expected. Blunt traumas are more likely to cause neuropraxia. Transected nerves from penetrating trauma cause immediate loss of function, both muscle and sensation, and do not return unless surgically repaired.","177":"Yeast are fungi that live on our skin and mucous surfaces of our bodies. In small numbers, they don't cause any problem. Under certain circumstances, their numbers increase. This is more likely to happen after taking an antibiotic. The antibiotic kills the normal bacteria that live in the vagina allowing the fungus to grow without any competition. Yeast vaginitis is very common and usually caused by Candida albicans.","178":"When someone travels to a higher altitude there is less oxygen available to breathe. Most people do not have any symptoms besides decreased exercise tolerance. Some patients can actually become ill with symptoms ranging from nausea and headache to significant shortness of breath and confusion.  Although rare, in its most serious form patients can have a fluid buildup in their lungs (pulmonary edema) and\/or in their brains (cerebral edema). This condition usually does not occur until one travels above 8,000 feet. Exercising immediately after going to a high altitude increases the likelihood of acquiring this disorder.","179":"Vitamin D deficiency is a disorder that can lead to weakening of bones and diseases such as rickets and osteomalacia. Vitamin D is necessary for the body to maintain normal blood calcium and phosphorous levels and healthy bones. Vitamin D is produced by the skin in response to sunlight. It can be absorbed from vitamin D fortified foods and\/or supplements.","18":"The stomach muscles do not work properly preventing the food from being pushed into the intestines leading to nausea, vomiting and stomach pain. Normally contraction of the stomach muscles pushes food into the first part of the intestine (duodenum). In gastroparesis the muscles fail to contract. It is believed damage to the vagus nerve that controls the stomach muscles is the primary cause of this disorder. The most common causes of vagus nerve damage are surgery and diseases such as diabetes, scleroderma, medications (narcotics, antidepressants), anorexia, Parkinson's disease and hypothyroidism. Gastroparesis can lead to malnutrition, bacterial overgrowth in the stomach, and blood sugar fluctuations. ","180":"A partial thickness injury of the skin, often from scraping it.","181":"Whiplash occurs when there is injury to the ligaments, muscles and\/or tendons of the neck.  The term whiplash injury is not used when there is an associated fracture or herniated disc. It occurs with a sudden movement of the head forward and backward or side to side, such as in a car accident. It is also called neck strain, neck sprain, cervical sprain, or cervical strain.","182":"A disorder characterized by an unpleasant, temporary disturbance that occurs while traveling. Symptoms include dizziness, nausea and\/or vomiting. The symptoms become worse with any head movement, and lessen when the eyes are closed. ","183":"Severe elevation of blood pressure with acute damage of an organ system (usually the brain, heart and\/or kidneys) and possibly permanent damage. To reverse the damage the blood pressure should be lowered aggressively over minutes to hours. Triggers include: not taking blood pressure medications, abruptly stopping a blood pressure medication, drugs abuse (cocaine, methamphetamine), severe elevation of thyroid hormone, and taking certain over the counter medications.","184":"Occurs when the body is deprived of its normal supply of water or excessive water is lost. There is a delicate balance in the body between water and dissolved substances. This condition is most life-threatening in newborns, infants and persons over 60. Dehydration occurs when the body loses more fluids then it takes in. The loss of fluid can come from vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, or urination. Severe dehydration can lead to renal failure, and cardiovascular collapse.","185":"Tearing of the uterus that occurs during labor. If not immediately treated it can result in the death of the fetus and the mother. It is more common in women with previous C-sections. The first sign of the disorder is marked fetal bradycardia.","186":"Thyroid cysts are fluid-filled cavities in the thyroid gland. The majority of cysts are benign (non-cancerous) but some can contain malignant cells (cancerous). Most will shrink in size over time. However, some may grow and become symptomatic.","187":"A fold from the end of the rectum can bulge outside of the body, at the anus. The rectum is the last part of the large intestine attaching to the anus. Normally the rectum is attached inside the body by ligaments and muscles. Chronic constipation, childbirth, and other disorders can damage these attachments causing a small amount of the rectum to sag through the anus. It commonly occurs with straining to pass a stool. Rectal prolapsed is most often seen in the elderly and is more common in women.","188":"The humerus is the upper arm connecting the shoulder to the elbow. It is a common fracture in all ages and usually occurs due to direct trauma, such as falling on the arm. Treatment depends on the location, severity of the injury and age of the patient. The fracture can damage adjacent nerves and arteries.","189":"A life threatening condition where too much narcotic is taken resulting in decreased breathing and if untreated death. Loss of normal swallowing reflexes can occur; and if the patient vomits the stomach contents can enter the lungs. This is called aspiration and can result in a serious lung infection called aspiration pneumonia. A heart attack or stroke can occur because depressed breathing decreases oxygen supply to the heart and brain.","19":"A fracture is a broken bone. There are 27 bones in the hand and fractures are a common injury If after the fracture the pieces of the bone do not come together properly, they will be put back in place and splinted. Sometimes surgery is needed to realign the bones and to place a screw or wire to stabilize the bones while they heal. Severe fractures may have an associated tendon, nerve or blood vessel injury. If the broken bone punctures the skin (open fracture) antibiotics will be needed to prevent an infection of the bone (osteomyelitis).","190":"Also called canker sores. These are superficial ulcerations in the mucus membranes of the mouth that can cause significant discomfort. They usually resolve in 5-7 days but may re-appear. The cause of these ulcers is not known.","191":"Delusional disorder is an uncommon form of psychosis. The affected person is fixated on a false belief that has no basis in reality. The belief is held firmly despite evidence to the contrary. Several types of delusions are possible and include feelings of persecution or jealousy, feeling controlled by an outside force or irrational bodily complaints.","192":"The Ebola and Lassa viruses are 2 of 18 viruses known to cause viral hemorrhagic fever. The disorder involves an overall damage to the vascular system manifested by bleeding and multi-organ dysfunction. The virus is not present in the U.S. but can be acquired by traveling to sub-Sahara Africa. The disease is frequently fatal. The disease can be acquired by handling infected fecal matter of infected rodents.","193":"Rabies is a fatal viral disease passed to humans from infected animals. Patients contract the virus by being bitten by an infected animal since the virus is present in the animal\u2019s saliva. Exposure of an open wound or mucous membrane to infected saliva or bat guano can also rarely cause rabies. The virus infects the brain and once symptoms appear is almost always fatal which is why prevention and immunization of exposed patients is so important. The disease can be contracted from pets although the most common source is wild animals. Stray dogs and cats in developing countries are also a significant cause of the disease. The most common pets that can transmit rabies are: cats, dogs, cows, rabbits, ferrets, horses and goats. The most common wild animals are: bats, beavers, woodchucks, coyotes, skunks, monkeys, raccoons and foxes.","194":"Fainting caused by a vasovagal reaction. A vasovagal reaction is the most common cause of fainting. It is an over stimulus of the parasympathetic nervous system by such triggers as the sight of blood or extreme emotional distress. The response causes a slowing of the heart rate and a drop in the blood pressure resulting in decreased blood flow to the brain and a loss of consciousness. It is the reason people faint when they hear bad news or have their blood drawn.","195":"Cardiac arrest is also called sudden cardiac death (SCD). During cardiac arrest, the heart stops pumping blood around the body. A person promptly loses consciousness. If the pumping of the heart is not restored within 4 minutes, the brain will die. The most common reason for SCD is a myocardial infarction (heart attack) that leads to a fast irregular heartbeat. Starting CPR immediately is the number one determinant of a patient surviving a cardiac arrest. ","196":"Invasive ductal carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that begins in the milk ducts and eventually spreads outside the ducts and into the surrounding tissue. It is the most common form of breast cancer. Although invasive ductal carcinoma can affect women of any age, it is more common in women over the age of 55.","197":"One of the autoimmune diseases associated with inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis). It causes ulcers and sores in the mouth, genitalia, and skin. Patients can also have stiffness and swelling in the joints (arthritis), eye involvement (uveitis), and form blood clots, especially in the legs. The inflamed blood vessels are thought to be caused by an overactive immune system, but what triggers this abnormal response is not known. The disease is more common in young adults from the Middle East, Japan, and Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n","198":"Patients have a distorted self-perception of their body, think they are overweight, and have an irrational fear of becoming obese. This disorder can be very serious and patients can become dangerously underweight and malnourished. Anorexia is also called anorexia nervosa and is most often seen in women in their teenage and early adult years. ","199":"Anal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the anus. The opening at the end of the rectum that allows feces to leave the body. Infection with the human papilloma virus is a leading cause of this cancer. Anal cancer is often discovered early and only rarely spreads (metastasizes) to other areas of the body. ","2":"Wilms' tumor is the most common form of kidney cancer in children. Wilms\u2019 tumor or nephroblastoma occurs when there is growth of abnormal cells in the kidney. These abnormal cells increase in number and produce a tumor. Wilms' tumor is more common in African-American children and slightly more common in female children.","20":"Repeated and\/or persistent inflammation of the pancreas causes scarring and destruction of the pancreas. Normally, the pancreas makes digestive enzymes and the hormone insulin. When the pancreas is damaged, lack of digestive enzymes can cause diarrhea and weight loss due to poor digestion. Lack of insulin can cause diabetes. Chronic pancreatitis can cause constant pain in the abdomen. The most common cause of chronic pancreatitis is heavy alcohol consumption.","200":"A subungual hematoma is a visible collection of blood underneath the nail. It occurs after trauma to the nail and is sometimes associated with a fracture of the finger. The symptoms of pain worsen as the blood accumulates and causes increasing pressure on the finger.","201":"Tumor in the orbit area. The orbit contains the eyeball, eye muscles, the optic nerve and blood vessels. The majority of tumors that arise in the orbit are benign.","202":"Tic disorders include a variety of disorders, such as Tourette's syndrome, that result in sudden, rapid, non-rhythmic movements or speech. Tic disorders are more common in males than females. They are also more common in children. The exact cause of tics is unknown at this time.","203":"Mosquito bites are generally not dangerous. Mosquitoes can pass infections to humans through their saliva during a bite. Examples of such disease include: West Nile virus, malaria, Dengue fever, and Japanese encephalitis. ","204":"Acetaminophen is primarily metabolized by the liver. Too much acetaminophen (Tylenol) can overwhelm the liver, thereby producing toxic substances that can destroy the liver, resulting in death.","205":"An elbow dislocation occurs when the bones of the forearm move out of their normal alignment with the upper arm bone (humerus). When the bones move from their normal position, they can no longer move freely and there is potential for decreased blood flow and permanent damage. An elbow dislocation is the most common dislocation in childhood and the second most common dislocation in adulthood. Trauma related to sports activities accounts for the majority of elbow dislocations. Immediate medical treatment should be sought to avoid potentially permanent damage to nerves and blood vessels.","206":"A lung cancer located in the top of the lung (apex). Cancer in this location can cause a specific pattern of symptoms, because nerves that control the face and blood drainage from the face can be affected. Lung cancers in this location generally have a poor prognosis.","207":"Facial lacerations can be simple or complex. Complex lacerations can involve loss of tissue and may require plastic surgery repair. Lacerations that extend perpendicular to the normal lines of expression leave more noticeable scars and require meticulous repair. Facial drooping is present if underlying nerves are injured.","208":"An intense itching and urge to scratch in and around the anus. The symptoms are most noticeable at night or after a bowel movement. Some patients experience a burning sensation and\/or note blood on the toilet paper after passing a stool. The most common causes are prolonged moisture in the area, certain foods, topical irritants, and rarely a parasite called pinworms. This is a common problem that affects up to 5% of the population.","209":"A forceful twisting of the foot causing a stretch or tear of the ligaments in the foot, but no fracture (broken bone). The foot is divided into 3 regions: a forefoot (toes), a mid-foot (central), and a hind-foot (ankle and heel region). Injuries can occur in all three areas of the foot, but the most common region for the injury to occur is the mid-foot region. Sprains are commonly graded in a severity range from Grade I (mild) to Grade III (severe). Most mild sprains heal on their own with just rest. Severe injuries may need immobilization and\/or surgical repair.","21":"Platelets are cells that help the body form blood clots. Low platelets, also called thrombocytopenia, can occur from insufficient production of platelets, or from increased destruction. Some causes are: immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia, drug-induced nonimmune thrombocytopenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), an enlarged spleen, aplastic anemia, cancer and infection.","210":"A term used for high blood pressure. There are two numbers with the top number representing the systolic pressure  and the bottom number the diastolic pressure.  The generally accepted definition of hypertension is persistent blood pressure readings of 140\/90 mm Hg or higher. Hypertension usually causes no symptoms but is a major risk factor for a number of serious long term problems including heart attacks, stroke and kidney failure.","211":"An inflammation of the sheath that surrounds two tendons that control movement of the thumb. The inflammation causes the sheath around the tendon to swell and enlarge, making thumb and wrist movement painful. Making a fist and grasping objects are commonly painful with de Quervain's tenosynovitis.","212":"Hairs found in clothing or bedding can wrap around the penis causing decreased blood flow and if untreated, infarction of the penis. The only symptom may be excessive crying and fussiness in an infant.","213":"A skin condition characterized by dry itchy skin. The skin can become red and at times form fluid filled sacs or blisters. Patients usually have this condition all their lives and it is more common in infants and children. Atopic dermatitis is believed to be caused by an overactive immune system causing patients to react to certain substances more than the general population. People with this condition are more likely to have allergic rhinitis and asthma.","214":"An infectious viral disease, most often caused by the Ebstein Barr virus. This disease occurs commonly in adolescents and young adults and is characterized by fever, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes and marked fatigue. Also known as \"Mono\". Some patients will also have an enlargement of their spleen. This splenic enlargement puts them at risk of life threatening splenic rupture with even minimal abdominal trauma. ","215":"A rash that causes itching. There are many causes of an itchy rash but the most common are an allergic reaction and eczema.","216":"The esophagus is the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. A stricture causes a narrowing of the esophagus resulting in difficulty swallowing. The stricture can be caused by gastroesophageal reflux, previous endoscopy, trauma, infections, cancer or ingestion of a corrosive substance (such as bleach or drain cleaners).","217":"Gallbladder cancer is the growth of abnormal cells in the gallbladder. These abnormal cells ultimately grow and produce a tumor. This cancer is rare. It is more likely to occur in women compared to men and in people with gallstones. ","218":"Benign migratory glossitis is an inflammation of the papillae (tiny bumps) on the tongue. It causes the loss of some papillae, which results in smooth, reddish areas bordered by white. These patches may appear and disappear in different places on the tongue. They may have an irregular shape that resembles a map. Geographic tongue is found in about 2 of every 100 people. The cause is unknown. ","219":"Pit vipers are the most prevalent family of poisonous snakes in the United States and include rattlesnakes, water moccasins and copperheads. The venom is a complex mixture of enzymes, which varies from species to species. The venom is designed to immobilize, kill, and digest the snake's prey. The venom works by destroying tissue, and is capable of causing significant and disfiguring local tissue damage. Deaths in the United States are rare and limited almost entirely to children and the elderly. The Mohave rattlesnake is different than the other pit vipers and has a potent neurotoxin and produces a different set of symptoms.\r\n","22":"Occurs when one or more small areas within the spleen are deprived of blood flow, usually from traveling clots that block small blood vessels in the spleen. The spleen is located in the left upper abdomen under the ribs. This organ removes old red blood cells from the serum and holds red blood cells for emergency use by the body. The spleen is also important in fighting infection by removing bacteria covered by the body's antibodies. Splenic infarction can occur in the following conditions: artificial heart valves, infected heart valves, hypercoagulable states, cancer, and trauma to the spleen.","220":"Traveler's diarrhea is the commonly used term for diarrhea related to ingesting contaminated food or water. The most common type of bacteria that causes this disease is E. coli. Roughly fifty percent of all travelers that visit the developing world will develop traveler's diarrhea. The diarrhea is watery and usually does not contain blood.","221":"Parasites live in or on another animal or insect. The infected organism is called the host and is injured by the parasite. This medical condition is more common in rural areas of the world.","222":"An abnormality in the heart rhythm. The long QT syndrome is sometimes inherited. The following conditions can also cause this disorder: certain medications (erythromycin, moxifloxacin, terfenadine), abnormal blood chemistry (low potassium, low calcium, or low magnesium), heart attacks, cocaine abuse, and stroke. The disease is diagnosed based on certain findings on an EKG. The distance between two waves  called Q and T is abnormally prolonged. This abnormality can lead to lethal heart rhythms such as ventricular tachycardia and Torsades de pointes, in which the heart stops beating effectively. If untreated, it can result in unexplained fainting (syncope) and death. Once found in a family member, other relatives may need to be tested for the disorder.","223":"An uncoordinated series of muscle contractions that prevent food from traveling normally from the esophagus to the stomach. These spasms can be very painful. Very hot or cold foods can cause the symptoms. Chest pain is a common symptom of esophageal spasm, and can be mistaken for angina. The precise cause of this disorder is unknown.","224":"A foreign object that hits the cornea can cause an injury. The cornea is a transparent covering of the center of the eye. It allows light to penetrate into the eye, where it strikes the retina and is eventually interpreted by the brain as vision. The cornea is soft and the foreign object may become lodged in it. If the foreign object is metal a rust ring can develop around the injury as well. If the foreign body and the rust ring are not removed a corneal scar can occur resulting in permanent vision loss.","225":"A fever is the body's way of reacting to something abnormal in the body. Fevers, on their own, aren't bad for you unless they become too high or last too long though they can make you feel awful. The cause of the fever is the bigger concern. Fevers may help the body fight infections but that should not prevent a patient from trying to lower the temperature. Fevers can be caused by a number of conditions including: infections, reactions to medications, reactions to blood transfusions, cancer, or autoimmune diseases.","226":"Inflammation of the vagina. The most common causes include: bacterial infection, yeast infection, atrophy from lack of estrogen, trichomonas infection or from chemical irritation. If bacteria or trichomonas is the cause, the sexual partners should be treated as well to prevent re-infection.","227":"An abnormal collection of fluid near the testicle in the scrotum. The condition is most common in infant boys and elderly men. In infants hydroceles are usually due to a congenital abnormality. In the elderly they develop from trauma, inflammation or infection causing blockage of blood or fluid. They can be associated with an inguinal hernia.","228":"A contagious viral illness caused by the poliovirus. There are three basic patterns of polio infection: subclinical infections, nonparalytic, and paralytic. Approximately 95% of infections are subclinical infections and do not experience any symptoms. In its most severe form, polio causes paralysis, difficulty breathing and sometimes death. Polio virus is very contagious and spreads most commonly through contact with infected feces, or through ingestion of contaminated food or water. It also can spread by respiratory droplets that are released into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. People who are infected can have no symptoms can still spread the virus to others for weeks to months. An immunization (vaccine) is available against polio. ","229":"A collection of infectious fluid (pus) in the brain. The abscess can be caused by bacteria, fungi or parasites. The most common causes of this disorder include: direct injury from trauma, spread of bacteria through the blood stream - usually from the mouth or lung, and from direct spread from an ear infection.","23":"Shoulder pain resulting from pressure on the rotator cuff from part of the shoulder blade (scapula) as the arm is lifted. The rotator cuff is a tendon linking four muscles of the shoulder. These muscles cover the head of the humerus and allow the shoulder to lift and rotate the shoulder.","230":"A fungus (a form of yeast) that can cause infection of the mouth, throat, and genitalia. Yeast infection is common in healthy women with 75% having a vaginal candida infection in their lifetime. In patients with weakened immune systems infections can be present in the blood or organs. This is a much more serious infection than the more common mouth or genital infection. This infection is more common in diabetics, patients taking antibiotics, and in patients with weakened immune systems (including cancer patients and patients with HIV infection). ","231":"An extreme alteration in thinking, behavior and\/or consciousness caused by the consumption of alcohol (ethanol).Typically causes impulsive and uninhibited behavior. Alcohol affects people differently. A particular amount may only make one person act drunk, while be very dangerous to another person possibly causing depressed breathing, coma, and death.","232":"Spinal stenosis of the thoracic spine is narrowing of the spinal canal of the upper back. The narrowing can cause compression of the spinal cord and nerves exiting the spine. The canal becomes narrowed by arthritis and degeneration of the bones and ligaments, by a herniated disc, or from a tumor. It is more common in patients older than 60, but may occur at any age. Thoracic spine stenosis is less common than lumbar or cervical spinal stenosis.","233":"An infection that involves the fallopian tubes, uterus, and\/or ovaries. The fallopian tubes connect the ovaries to the uterus. Most cases of PID are from bacteria that are spread through sexual contact. Over one million American women a year get PID. The infection increases the risk of future ectopic pregnancy and infertility.","234":"A pattern of drinking alcohol (ethanol) that leads to physical harm and\/or harm to interpersonal, family or work relationships.","235":"A contagious skin disease caused by a small insect, a mite called Sarcoptes scabiei. The burrowing of the mite into the skin causes intense itching that is worse at night. The infection can be easily spread through close contact among families, schools, child care centers or nursing homes.","236":"Fungi grow as either yeast or mold. Fungi can live on the skin, in the mouth and vagina without causing any problems. When they grow excessively however, it can lead to conditions such as skin rashes, thrush and vaginal yeast infections. Also the spores can be inhaled and then fungi can grow in the lungs. ","237":"The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a joint that allows the lower jaw to move. The joint has three parts: a ball, a socket and a \"disc\" that sits between them.  When the mouth opens, the ball slides over the disc and moves slightly out of the socket. It returns to the socket as the mouth closes. The joint is dislocated when the ball comes too far out of the socket and gets stuck in front of the disc. This prevents the mouth from closing. It happens most often when the ligaments that normally keep the ball in place are loose.","238":"Gallbladder and bile duct cancers are the growth of abnormal cells in the gallbladder and\/or the tubes that connect the gallbladder to the liver and intestines. These abnormal cells ultimately grow and produce a tumor, which can cause pain and\/or the inability to drain bile. The chemical in bile called bilirubin backs up into the bloodstream and produces a characteristic yellow skin and eye coloring called jaundice. These cancers are rare. People with a higher risk of developing one of these cancers include those with liver fluke infections, sclerosing cholangitis, ulcerative colitis and cirrhosis.","239":"A problem with inattentiveness, over-activity, and\/or impulsivity. Children may struggle with low self-esteem, troubled relationships and poor performance in school. The symptoms must be out of the normal range for the child's age and development. The disorder affects millions of children and can persist into adulthood. ADHD, also sometimes referred to as just plain attention deficit disorder (ADD). ","24":"A type of vasculitis that causes inflammation of the arteries, primarily in the head. It most commonly affects one or both temporal arteries, which are located on the side of the scalp. The most common symptoms are headache, muscle aches and low grade fever. Prompt treatment is essential to avoid vision loss. Temporal arteritis occurs in people over age 50. Women are affected more often than men. This disease is also called giant cell arteritis and is related to polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR).","240":"Small growths of skin that appear as flesh colored \"tags\" on the skin. They are not cancerous. Some patients can have many skin tags on their body. Being overweight increases the likelihood of developing skin tags. The most common area to find skin tags are the neck and arm pits.","241":"Mongolian spots are flat, blue or blue-gray skin markings that commonly appear at birth or shortly after. They are not a sign of disease. They are more commonly seen in East Asians, Turks, East Africans, Polynesians, and Native Americans. They typically disappear in 3-5 years. They can sometimes look like bruises and children that have them are sometimes mistakenly thought to have been victims of child abuse.","242":"Periodontitis is a condition that involves inflammation of the gums and other structures that support the teeth. Periodontitis is caused by a bacterial infection. The body's attempt to fight the infection results in damage to the jaw bone and the ligament around the teeth. Pockets form between the teeth and gums. Teeth may become loose and even fall out. Older adults, people with diabetes, and people who smoke are more likely to get periodontitis.","243":"Some teeth have cracks that are too small to show up on an X-ray. Sometimes the cracks are under the gum. These small cracks are known as \"cracked tooth syndrome.\" It is most common in lower back teeth (molars).  Grinding the teeth or having a lot of pressure on one tooth may increase the risk of cracked tooth syndrome. Teeth that have large fillings or root canal treatment also may be more likely to have cracks.","244":"A psychiatric disease characterized by a distorted interpretation of reality resulting in hallucinations, delusions, and disordered thinking and behavior. Contrary to belief it does not mean a split personality. Untreated, the disease can cause severe emotional, behavioral, health, and legal and financial problems. Lifelong treatment is needed, and can enable many patients to live normal productive lives. This is a serious mental disorder with a high risk of suicide. The disease usually first appears in the teenage years.","245":"Small, usually painless growths on the skin caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). They are harmless but can be disfiguring and embarrassing. When present on the feet they can cause pain with walking. There are multiple types: Common warts are typically found on the hands; flat warts occur on the face; genital warts are found in the pubic area, between the legs, in the vagina and rectum; plantar warts occur on the bottom of the feet; subungual and periungual warts are found under and around the nails of the fingers and toes. The HPV virus is spread from person to person. Infection can also occur by touching a towel or other object that contains the virus.","246":"A collection of blood in the soft tissues, outside of the blood vessels, generally the result of bleeding from trauma. Similar (or identical) to a large bruise.","247":"An abnormal and malignant growth of cells of the vagina and vulva. It occurs most often in women older than 60 but can affect any age group. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common cause, although adenocarcinomas, sarcomas, and melanomas are also seen. Women with an infection of the human papilloma virus (HPV) are increased risk of developing the disease. This is one of the reasons the CDC recommends the HPV vaccine for all young girls and women.","248":"An inherited disorder that causes affected people to absorb and retain too much iron. The excess iron is stored throughout the body but concentrated in the liver, heart, and pancreas. These abnormal accumulations of iron cause liver failure (cirrhosis), heart disease (congestive heart failure), and diabetes. Treatment involves removing blood from your body to decrease the iron levels.","249":"An abnormal and cancerous growth of cells of the rectum. The rectum is the last part of the large intestine attaching to the anus. The rectum's primary function is to store formed stool in preparation for evacuation bowel movement. The following things increase the risk of rectal cancer: older age, smoking, high-fat diet, and personal or family history of polyps or colorectal cancer.","25":"A cyst is a sac or pouch that forms under the skin or in bone. Oral cysts are found in the head or neck. They can be in the jawbone, salivary glands, or mouth. There are many types of cysts. The most common type of oral cyst develops as a result of an infection in the tooth pulp, or nerve. Other common oral cysts may form at the crowns of teeth that have not fully come into the mouth (impacted teeth).","250":"Infection or non-infectious inflammation of the prostate gland. It can be either an acute or a chronic condition. The prostate gland is located under the bladder, where it surrounds the urethra (the bladder's drainage tube). The gland is a source of fluid for semen. The inflammation can irritate or put pressure on the tube connecting the bladder to the penis (urethra), resulting in difficultly urinating, and urinary retention. Palpation of the prostate during a rectal exam usually reveals a  tender prostate. Rarely an abscess can develop. This disorder is most often seen in 20-40 year old men, in those with a urinary catheter, and with patients having unprotected sex with multiple partners.","251":"A common injury that usually occurs with twisting the knee. The meniscus serves as cushion between the femur and tibia. It helps distribute the weight evenly across the joint. There are two menisci, one on the inner side of the knee (medial) and the other on the outer side (lateral). A torn meniscus can prevent the knee from bending normally causing it to lock.","252":"Trauma to the eye can range from a minor corneal abrasion to a vision threatening ruptured globe. More serious injuries result in visual problems, vomiting, and an irregular and\/or unresponsive pupil.","253":"Caused by a deficiency of an enzyme called lactase. The enzyme normally is made in the small intestine. It helps digest a sugar called lactose, the primary sugar found in milk products. Not all patients with low levels of lactase experience symptoms. Patients must have low levels of lactase and have symptoms to be diagnosed with this disorder. Lactase deficiency can occur with aging, or after a physical stress such as bowel surgery, infections of the small intestine, or with celiac disease.","254":"A type of tendonitis (inflammation of a tendon) that causes pain in the elbow and arm. It is also called tennis elbow (though one does not have to play tennis to get this condition). A tendon is a band of fibrous tissue that connects a muscle to a bone allowing movement when the muscle contracts. Lateral epicondylitis is one of the most common causes of significant elbow pain.","255":"A common condition characterized by episodes of excessive unexplained crying, fussiness to agonized screaming. Colic affects infants up to 5 months old and is more common in first born males. In some babies, it may be due to a greater sensitivity than usual to intestinal gas. Some cry from hunger, others from overfeeding. Some breastfed babies are intolerant of foods in their mothers' diets, and some bottle-fed babies are intolerant of the proteins in formula. When other people around them are worried, anxious, or depressed, babies with colic may cry more, which in turn makes those around them even more worried, anxious, or depressed. ","256":"An extra portion of bone that arises from the heel and is the attachment of the plantar fascia. The plantar fascia is a thick fibrous band in the bottom of the foot that can become inflamed and cause the condition plantar fascitis. About 70% of patients with plantar fascitis have a heel spur but some patients with heel spurs do not experience any discomfort. It is unclear if the heel spur is actually contributing to the pain. ","257":"A condition of low glucose (sugar) in the blood. Causes of hypoglycemia include: 1) taking too much insulin or other diabetic medications; 2) not eating or drinking enough; 3) liver failure; 4) an insulin producing tumor of the pancreas; 5) drinking excessive alcohol. Sometimes no cause is found. If severe and untreated it can lead to stroke and death.","258":"A viral infection that is acquired from a mosquito bite (Aedes mosquito). The infection is most often seen in Africa, Asia and India. In recent years, the virus has traveled to Central and South America, and to the Caribbean islands. The illness is rarely fatal and many infected patients experience no symptoms at all. It is a common cause of fever in patients traveling to the geographic areas of infection.","259":"A pregnancy during which the fetus develops outside the uterus. It occurs commonly in the fallopian tubes. An ectopic pregnancy can rupture and cause bleeding in the abdomen, and if left untreated can result in death. Ectopic pregnancy is more common in women with previous pelvic inflammatory disease, IUD use or a previous ectopic pregnancy.","26":"The female black widow gives the more serious bite, but its bite is rarely lethal. The spider is identified by the red hourglass marking on its belly. The bite feels like a pinprick. Some do not remember being bitten. The symptoms range from redness around the bite to severe abdominal pain, and muscle pain. The pain can be severe enough to be mistaken for appendicitis. These bites should not cause tissue damage.","260":"Hyperlipidemia means having high levels of cholesterol. Elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood increase the risk of having narrowed arteries. The blockage is caused by a build of fat deposits called plaque (atherosclerosis). The diseases caused by this narrowing depend on the arteries being blocked but include: angina, heart attacks, strokes, and peripheral vascular disease. People having elevated cholesterol are more likely to also have high blood pressure and diabetes. There are two types of cholesterol that make up the total level of cholesterol, LDL and HDL. LDL is considered bad cholesterol and HDL is good cholesterol. The most important number is the LDL cholesterol level. The ideal level is based on the person\u2019s individual risk of heart disease and stroke. A person\u2019s cholesterol profile is determined in part by inheritance, and in part by the foods he or she eats. ","261":"An involuntary urination in children over 5 to 6 years old. Enuresis is also called bed-wetting. It may occur at any time of the day but is far more common at night during sleep. With reassurance and training it usually resolves on its own. More rarely bed-wetting may be a sign of other disorders such as: urinary tract infection (bladder infection), diabetes, chronic constipation, and an abnormal bladder or urinary tract. It occurs in about 10% of children over 5. Enuresis can sometimes be triggered by stress. ","262":"Fungal infection of the skin. It can occur in any area of the skin, scalp or involve the nails. ","263":"Fungal infection of the skin. It can occur in any area of the skin, scalp or involve the nails. ","264":"Inflammation of the urethra. The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. The disease is often classified as gonococcal urethritis or non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU). NGU has both infectious and non-infectious causes. In men, a thick yellow discharge usually indicates a gonococcal urethritis; while clear discharge is more suggestive of NGU. The disorder is difficult to diagnose in women because discharge may not be present. Both sexes may experience burning with urination. The causes of NGU include adenovirus, Chlamydia trachomatis, Escherichia coli, Herpes simplex, Mycoplasma genitalium, and trichomonas.","265":"The clavicle (collar bone) connects the shoulder to the breast bone (sternum). A fracture is a broken bone. The clavicle is frequently broken when a patient falls and lands on the outside of the shoulder. The clavicle can also be fractured from a direct blow. Severe fractures can cause damage to the nerve or blood vessels of the arm.","266":"A physical and psychological addictive disorder. Smoking causes cancer, breathing problems, heart attacks, and stroke. Secondhand smoke causes asthma and breathing problems. Cigarettes contain dangerous chemicals including: tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide.","267":"A sleep disturbance characterized by difficulty falling asleep, difficulty remaining asleep, intermittent wakefulness, early morning awakening or a combination of these. It is more common in the elderly. \"Primary\" insomnia is insomnia that does not have an identified cause. \"Secondary\" insomnia may be caused by anxiety from a life crisis or lifestyle change, medical or psychological problems or drug intake.","268":"Premature ejaculation is unintentional ejaculation early in the act of intercourse. It is estimated that as many as one in five men have trouble with premature ejaculation at some point in their lives. Most cases of premature ejaculation are related to psychological factors. Physical causes include an inflammation of the prostate and spinal cord problems.\r\n","269":"Cancer that spreads to the bones. The most commonly affected sites are the spine, pelvis, skull and ribs. These cancers spread from the original site of the cancer (primary cancer) to the bones by traveling through the blood or lymphatic channels. The most common cancers that spread to the bones are prostate cancer, breast cancer, and lung cancer. ","27":"A rare syndrome that involves injury to the sympathetic nerves that control the face. It usually is caused by another disorder such as an injury, cancer or a stroke. Sometimes no cause for the symptoms is found. Usually only one side of the face is affected. Patients with this syndrome experience eyelid drooping, a smaller pupil and decreased sweating on the affected side of the face.","270":"Part of the stomach protrudes upward into the chest, through an opening in the diaphragm. The diaphragm is the muscle separating the chest from the abdomen and is used for breathing. The hiatal hernia can allow acid to enter the esophagus causing pain and ulceration of the esophagus.","271":"A collection of infected material just under the skin. The body walls off the infection, which traps the infected fluid. If untreated, the abscess can slowly grow or spontaneously erupt through the skin, leaking purulent fluid. Occasionally the infection can enter the blood stream and cause a life threatening illness. The disorder is usually secondary to a bacterial infection and is frequently caused by staphylococcal bacteria.","272":"A stab wound to the toe. These wounds can damage structures deep to the skin such as blood vessels, nerves, or tendons. The object that caused the wound can carry bacteria or foreign material deep into the wound and cause infections. Puncture wounds from animal or human bites are especially prone to infections. ","273":"A group of diseases caused by an abnormal accumulation of porphyrins in the body. Porphyrins are used to make hemoglobin, the molecule in the red blood cell that carries oxygen throughout the body.  Porphyria affects the nervous system and skin and is inherited. The nervous system type is called acute porphyria and the skin type is cutaneous porphyria. There is no cure for the disease but the symptoms can be controlled. Symptoms can be triggered by exposure to certain medications, excessive dieting, sun exposure, smoking, infections, drinking alcohol or hormones. If left untreated the disease can be very serious causing breathing problems, kidney failure, skin damage and liver problems.","274":"Occurs when tissue pushes through a weak spot in the groin muscle. This causes a bulge in the groin or scrotum. The bulge may hurt or burn. The hernia may get larger with straining. If the bulge does not go away with relaxation it can become lodged in the defect (an incarcerated hernia). Intestine can become trapped in the hernia and lose its blood supply leading to a serious surgical emergency named strangulation.","275":"A mental illness characterized by mood instability that can be serious and disabling. Bipolar disorder is also known as manic-depression or manic-depressive illness. Patients with this disorder suffer from extreme sadness (depression) coupled with periods of excessive energy and impulsive behavior. A milder form of this disorder is called cyclothymia. Bipolar disorder can be very serious and lead to suicidal thoughts and actions.","276":"A very infectious virus that in normal adults presents like a common cold. It causes infection in the nose, throat and\/or lungs. It can cause bronchiolitis or pneumonia. In people with weakened immune systems or in infants the disease can become very serious and lead to respiratory failure.","277":"The heart muscle becomes abnormally thick (hypertrophied). The thickened heart muscle can block the outflow of blood and lead to heart failure or a dangerous, unstable heart rhythm (arrhythmia). This disorder can be inherited. Sometimes patients do not have any symptoms with this disease; for some, the first symptom is sudden collapse and death from an arrhythmia. ","278":"A rare life-threatening complication of pregnancy that occurs in the third trimester or the immediate period after delivery. It is thought to be caused by a disordered metabolism in the mother. It can be fatal to the baby or the mother.","279":"The bowels are also called the small intestine (duodenum, ileum and jejunum), and the large intestine (colon). Partial or complete blockage in the bowel prevents gas, fluids, or solids from moving through the intestines normally. Causes of a bowel obstruction include: adhesions (narrowing due to scar tissue, most commonly following surgery), cancer, hernias, volvulus, severe constipation, colonic atresia and Crohn\u2019s disease. ","28":"Cardiomegaly is a descriptive term that refers to an enlarged heart. Cardiomegaly isn't a disease. Instead, it's the result of another condition, most often one that leads to heart failure. Cardiomegaly may develop temporarily or be a more permanent  condition. Cardiomegaly may be caused by high blood pressure, heart valve disease, coronary artery disease, high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension) and more rare diseases such as hemochromatosis and amyloidosis.","280":"Seborrheic keratoses are non-cancerous growths of the skin. They have a greasy appearance and can be tan, brown or black. They are usually found on the chest or back. They are rarely found in children and tend to occur more frequently as people age.","281":"A bacterial infection of the fat and small muscles surrounding the eye. The bacteria can first come from a stye, a bug bite or a recent eyelid injury and then move into deeper tissues. The infection can be very serious and lead to blindness. ","282":"Elevation of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure within the brain. It is also called benign intracranial hypertension. Typically the cause is never found. The disorder can put pressure on the optic nerve and cause visual problems as well as headache and vomiting. Young obese women appear to have a greater risk of developing this disorder.","283":"A heart rhythm problem (arrhythmia) caused by an abnormal electrical pathway in the heart. Normally the electrical impulse from the atrium to the ventricle travels through the atrioventricular (AV) node. In people with WPW the impulse bypasses the AV node by traveling through the abnormal pathway. This bypassing of the AV node causes an early contraction of the ventricle (preexcitation) and irregular heart rhythms. At times the rates can be very fast and life threatening.","284":"Breast cancer is a cancer that starts in the cells of the breast in women and men. This is the second most common type of cancer in women. There are many different types of breast cancer with ductal carcinoma being the most frequent. Early detection and treatment improves the chance for cure. ","285":"A disorder that causes abnormal red blood cells that can clog blood vessels. Sickle cell disease is the most common of the inherited blood disorders, and is seen primarily in black Americans and black Africans. A sickle cell crisis causes pain because blood vessels become blocked by the defective red blood cells, which can damage organs in the body. The most commonly affected organs include: lungs, liver, bone, muscles, brain, spleen, penis, eyes, and kidneys. Patients also experience chronic anemia.","286":"SARS is a respiratory illness that first infected people in parts of Asia, North America, and Europe in late 2002 and early 2003. SARS is caused by a type of coronavirus, in the same family of viruses that cause the common cold. The SARS virus is known as SARS-CoV. SARS is spread by respiratory droplets that are released into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can also be spread through direct contact with contaminated objects or surfaces. SARS can be fatal.","287":"A hemorrhagic stroke is bleeding within the brain that disrupts the normal function of the brain. The bleeding can occur within the brain or between the brain and the skull (subarachnoid). Hemorrhagic strokes account for about 15% of all strokes. They can occur when a weak blood vessel (aneurysm) bursts or after a stroke caused by a clot. High blood pressure, advanced age, heavy alcohol use, and\/or methamphetamine use increase the risk of these strokes. The symptoms experienced depend on the area of the brain that is affected. Survival and the best outcome depend on seeking medical care immediately.","288":"A collection of pus in the liver. The most common causes of the infection include bacteria and amoeba (Entamoeba histolytica). One way bacteria enter the liver is spread of infection from a diseased gallbladder. In addition, organisms may travel through the blood stream and settle in the liver developing into an abscess.","289":"Inflammation of a joint caused by deposits of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals in joints. A single large joint such as the knee is typically involved. The disorder is seen most commonly in people over 60 years of age. It usually causes multiple recurrent attacks, and a single attack can lasts days to weeks. ","29":"A bruise of the brain caused by trauma. The injury causes small areas of localized bleeding within the brain. The symptoms experienced are determined by the area of the brain that is injured and the size of the contusion. The frontal and temporal lobes are most commonly affected. ","290":"A viral infection (flavivirus) that infects the brain (encephalitis) acquired from the bite of a mosquito (Culex mosquito). The disease is found in Asia and is very rare in the United States but is occasionally seen in people returning from Asia. Infections can result in mild disease or a rapidly progressive fatal course. This disorder is the leading cause of encephalitis in Asia. There is a vaccine against this disease and it is recommended for anyone with an extended visit to an effected area.","291":"A hernia that pushes through the canal containing the femoral artery and vein in the front of the upper thigh. Hernias occur when part of the intestine or abdominal fatty tissue (omentum) pushes through a weak point or tear in the lower abdominal wall. The resulting bulge may be painful and get larger when the patient coughs, bends over, or lifts a heavy object. Severe hernias may cause a blockage of the intestines. If the hernia cannot be pushed back in place by the doctor it is called incarcerated. Some incarcerated hernias block the blood supply to the trapped intestines resulting in a life threatening condition called a strangulated hernia.","292":"An epidermal cyst (sebaceous cyst) is a sac of material that looks like cheese. It develops when skin cells deposit keratin under the skin. The bumps are usually painless and movable. They can become inflamed and infected. They are found throughout the body including the scrotum.","293":"The tongue is covered with hundreds of tiny raised areas called papillae. Normally, the top layer of tongue cells wears away. In certain situations, however, the papillae grow unusually long. Bacteria and yeast trapped under the papillae multiply, producing a dark, furry looking coating of the tongue. The cause of black hairy tongue is not known. The condition is uncommon in healthy people. But those who don't take good care of their teeth and gums have an increased risk of black hairy tongue.","294":"Thoracic spondylosis is the term used to indicate degenerative changes in the joints and discs between the vertebrae of the mid to upper spine. This arthritis usually occurs because of the age-related degenerative disease that develops in the joints and discs of the spine. Everyone experiences some wear and tear of the mid and upper back joints as we age.  But some have more severe damage causing significant pain and stiffness. As the arthritis develops there can be the development of bone spurs, or osteophytes. The rough edges of these bone spurs can irritate the nearby nerves, ligaments and muscles causing different types of pain. Spondylosis of the spine is one of the most common causes of pain in the elderly.","295":"The most common sexually transmitted infection (STI). There are many HPV types that can infect the genital areas of males and females, and some can also infect the mouth and throat. HPV is acquired during sexual intercourse with someone who is infected. Unfortunately most people do not know they are infected with the virus since the initial symptoms can be minor. In 90% of people the virus is cleared from the body without any treatment. Some types of HPV can cause genital warts and rarely warts in the throat. Other HPV types can cause cervical cancer, cancer of the anus, and cancer of the throat. ","296":"Malformations of the blood vessels that feed the heart that are present at birth (congenital). They occur in 1% of the population and are often associated with other congenital heart defects. This disorder accounts for 4%-15% of sudden cardiac deaths in young people. Symptoms may not be present until the early teen years depending on the location and severity of the defect. Sometimes the first indication something is wrong is a life threatening event such as a heart attack or abnormal beating of the heart that causes it to stop pumping. Some malformations do not cause symptoms and are discovered at autopsy.","297":"A neurological disorder caused by severe inflammation of the spinal cord. The condition involves an entire cross section of the spinal cord preventing the brain from communicating with the body below the level of the inflammation. Weakness and numbness occur below the involved area of the spinal cord. The disorder occurs in both adults and children, and typically begins with a rapid development of symptoms over the course of several hours to weeks. The condition can follow a viral infection or it may be related to an autoimmune disease.","298":"Ethylene glycol is a solvent found in products ranging from antifreeze fluid and de-icing solutions to carpet and fabric cleaners. Ingestion causes transformation of the ethylene glycol into toxic byproducts that damage the kidneys and brain. If untreated the disorder can be fatal. These ingestions are usually intentional, where ethylene glycol is used as a substitute for alcohol. (This is usually in the setting of severe alcoholism.) ","299":"Patients have a distorted self-perception of their body, think they are overweight, and have an irrational fear of becoming obese. This disorder can be very serious and patients can become dangerously underweight and malnourished. Anorexia is also called anorexia nervosa and is most often seen in women in their teenage and early adult years. ","3":"Occurs when the skin and underlying tissue freezes due to being exposed to extreme cold. Exposure to the cold first causes frost-nip, which is reversible skin irritation. If rewarming doesn't occur frost-nip can progress to frostbite. Frostbite affects the fingers, toes and face, and tends to occur in those who do not feel the effects of frost-nip or those who cannot or will not remove themselves from the cold. The disorder is more often associated with alcoholism, psychiatric illness, diabetes, smokers and previous frostbite.","30":"A condition caused by a member of the herpesvirus family. In most people with a normal immune system CMV infection does not cause any symptoms or disease. Some people with this infection develop a mononucleosis-like syndrome. Immunocompromised patients can develop chronic infections of the eyes, lungs, brain or intestine. If a pregnant patient becomes infected with CMV she can pass the infection to her baby causing significant disease to the newborn including death. ","300":"Lacerations of the arm can be simple, involving only the skin. Or they may be complex, with injury to tendons, nerves and\/or blood vessels. With tendon lacerations, there is weakness in the part of the extremity (arm, wrist, hand, finger) normally moved by the tendon, and with nerve damage, numbness is experienced beyond the laceration.","301":"The disorder causes problems with reading and interpreting spoken language. Also called specific reading disability, or developmental reading disorder. It affects about 5% of children, and these children typically have average to above average intelligence. There is a problem processing images into language, and is thought to originate from a part of the brain that serves this function. The disorder tends to run in families.","302":"Depression occurring in the first few weeks after the baby is born. The term `puerperal' refers to the six week period immediately following childbirth. This condition is identical to major depression except that it occurs right after delivery. The disorder affects 1 woman in every 500 who have given birth. The symptoms can be severe enough to impair normal functioning and can interfere with parent-to-baby bonding or in some cases may put the mother or baby's life at risk.","303":"Gallstones enter the bile ducts and block the passage of bile. The gallbladder is located in the right upper abdomen and stores bile pigments that are secreted by the liver and ultimately meant to be released into the gastrointestinal tract. Gallstones are found most commonly in the gallbladder, but can also be found in the bile ducts of the liver. Although both sexes are affected, women are affected more often with 20% of those over 40 having gallstones.","304":"Fibromas are single overgrowths of soft fibrous tissue. They commonly occur on the lips, inside the cheeks and on the tongue. They appear as relatively small, raised pink or white nodules or polyps. Fibromas may develop because of habits that create constant irritation of the lips, cheeks, or tongue. Irritation can be caused by a biting habit, teeth grinding, or rubbing of dentures. Fibromas can develop over weeks, months or years.","305":"Can be penetrating (gunshot wound or stabbing) or blunt (motor vehicle accident or fall). The trauma can result in injury to the teeth, jaw, lips, tongue, inner cheeks, gums, roof of the mouth (hard or soft palates), neck, or tonsils. ","306":"Male infertility is the inability to produce a pregnancy due to issues with the male sex partner. It is estimated that 20% of cases of infertility are the result of primary male infertility issues. The cause can be related to hormonal problems, sex organ malfunction, abnormal sperm function, drugs and certain illnesses. ","307":"Astigmatism is an irregularity of the shape of the cornea (the clear part of the eye covering the front of the eye). The irregular shape results in the scattering of light instead of focusing of light in a direct beam on the lens. This can cause blurred vision. Many people have some degree of astigmatism and it is thought that the condition is hereditary. Astigmatism often occurs with other vision conditions such as nearsightedness (myopia). ","308":"An autoimmune disease that attacks the kidneys and lungs and can result in kidney failure. The body makes antibodies that attack structures in the lungs and kidneys. This can lead to bleeding in the lungs and kidney damage. Viral infections or exposure to certain toxins can trigger this immune response. Men are eight times more likely to acquire this disease.","309":"A problem with the structure of the heart. It is present at birth and is the most common type of major birth defect. A baby's heart develops while in the womb and structural defects can occur during this time. These heart defects can involve any portion of the heart including the walls of the heart, the valves of the heart and the arteries and veins of the heart. The defects can disrupt the normal flow of blood through the heart, and prevent the baby from getting enough oxygen. Babies may not show signs of these problems immediately after birth but can begin having symptoms after they go home from the hospital. Some heart defects can be very serious and even result in death.","31":"Fragile X is an inherited disorder associated with mental retardation and a characteristic physical appearance. It is the most common cause of mental retardation in boys. It is caused by a change in a gene on the X chromosome (female sex chromosome). A small part of the gene is repeated randomly resulting in the symptoms associated with this syndrome. More severe symptoms occur with gene abnormalities that are repeated more frequently.","310":"A leg fracture is a break of one or more of the three bones in the leg (femur, tibia and\/or fibula). The fracture can occur in one place or multiple places (comminuted). Occasionally, a piece of bone may break through the skin. This is called an open fracture and must be treated aggressively to avoid infection. The fracture can bleed into the surrounding tissue resulting in bruising and, in severe cases, may result in a limb threatening condition called compartment syndrome. The fracture can also injure adjacent nerves, tendons or blood vessels.","311":"Diaper rash is an inflammatory rash affecting the skin in the region of the diaper. Moisture softens the skin and when combined with the acidity produced by urine and feces results in weakening of the normal protective layer of skin. The red rash that develops may be the result of the skin's reaction to chemical irritants, candidal infections (yeast) or bacterial infections. Diaper rash is the most common skin irritation in infants. Children using superabsorbent diapers are less likely to experience diaper rash than those using cloth diapers. ","312":"A foreign object in the ear is defined as anything in the canal (tube from the outside up to the eardrum) that does not normally belong there. They may include the end of a cotton swab, small toys, earrings, insects or food material such as a bean. Children often put small objects in their own ears or another child's ears.","313":"Low sodium levels in the blood. Sodium is important for maintaining blood pressure, and for the normal functioning of nerves and muscles. A sudden reduction in the blood sodium level or a severely low blood sodium level can cause lethal brain swelling. Causes of low sodium are: vomiting and diarrhea, burns, congestive heart failure, drugs that increase urine output (diuretics), kidney disease, cirrhosis, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).","314":"A condition caused by the formation of clots in tiny arteries leading to destruction of platelets and red blood cells and kidney damage. Most often it happens after a gastrointestinal infection caused by E. coli bacteria. The salmonella and shigella bacteria have also been implicated in this syndrome. This condition most commonly affects children resulting in one of the most common causes of acute kidney failure in this age group. ","315":"Coughing of blood. The blood usually comes from the lung or the tubes that carry air in the lungs (trachea, bronchi, bronchioles). This disorder is a serious symptom requiring urgent medical attention. Hemoptysis can be caused by many things, including infections, cancers, blood clots, and trauma.","316":"The ingestion of mushrooms containing psilocybine. Psilocybine causes hallucinations about 30 minutes after an oral ingestion. The intensity and duration of symptoms from psilocybine mushroom ingestion are highly variable, depending on species, dosage, individual physiology, and setting. ","317":"The failure of the ovaries before age 40. The ovaries stop producing the normal amount of hormones causing infertility, osteoporosis, and depression. Premature ovarian failure is different than premature menopause. Women with premature menopause stop having periods and cannot become pregnant while those with premature ovarian failure may still have irregular periods and even become pregnant. The most common causes of premature ovarian failure are: chromosomal problems such as Turner's syndrome, ovarian damage secondary to chemotherapy or radiation, and autoimmune diseases.","318":"Inflammation of the colon; common causes including infection, low blood flow (ischemia), or inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis).  Colitis may be of unknown cause.","319":"Excess fluid in the space (the peritoneal cavity) inside the abdomen that is not occupied by abdominal organs. There are many causes of ascites with the most common being cirrhosis of the liver and cancer. The fluid build-up can become severe enough to make breathing difficult. This happens because the fluid pushes upward on the lungs, which prevents their normal expansion. The fluid can also become infected leading to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, a potentially life threatening condition.","32":"Crossed eyes (strabismus) occurs when the eyes point in different directions. It can occur constantly or intermittently and affects approximately five percent of children. Male and female children are affected equally. Strabismus can occur as the result of problems with the eye muscles, the nerves of the eye or the brain. In adults, it is associated with certain conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis or thyroid disorders.","320":"Infections caused by bacteria that can involve any part of the body. The most common are urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and skin infections (cellulitis or abscess). Infections can be mild to life threatening.","321":"A fine shaking of the extremities, more likely to involve the hands, that becomes worse with activity such as drinking a glass of water. By definition there is not an underlying neurologic disease process causing the symptoms. It is common, especially in older people.","322":"A persistent, irrational or exaggerated fear of a particular object, situation, activity, setting or even a bodily function. Patients usually recognize that the fear is inappropriate to the situation, but cannot control their emotions or response. Avoidance of the agent or object can affect their social and work life.","323":"Respiratory failure results in inadequate oxygen delivery to the body and can lead to rapid death. The body's respiratory system is composed of the chest cavity and diaphragm, the lungs, the air tubes (trachea and bronchi) and the upper airway (mouth and throat). A disorder in any structure or a combination of these structures can cause a failure of the respiratory system.","324":"Trauma to the back may involve injury to the soft tissue (skin, muscles and ligaments) and bony injuries involving fractures, dislocations, and occasionally spinal cord injuries.","325":"A collection of infectious material adjacent to the spine. The most common causes are a complication of surgery, spread from an infection in the blood, infection spread from a nearby infection, or from an injury that penetrates the back allowing bacteria to enter. This is a rare disorder but is more common in intravenous drug users and patients with a weakened immune system.","326":"Varicose veins are the result of abnormal pooling of blood in the lower legs. Large dilated blood vessels can be seen through the skin of individuals affected with this problem. Over time, chronic pooling of blood can result in tissue damage and problems with skin infection (cellulitis), ulceration and blood clots (thrombophlebitis). The condition can run in the family in fifty percent of cases. Obese people and women are at a greater risk for development of varicose veins.  ","327":"A toe that becomes progressively deformed, and bent like a claw. This condition usually affects the second toe but may be present in any toe. The condition can be due to developmental abnormalities but is most often due to wearing ill-fitting shoes.","328":"Skin swelling can result from trauma, infection, inflammation, abscess, allergic reaction, or tumor. Inflammation can occur from a medication reaction, trauma or an autoimmune disease.","329":"A structural deformity of the bones and the joint between the foot and big toe. The big toe deviates toward the little toe with pain and swelling at the base of the big toe. This area of swelling, roughened skin and redness is called a bunion. High heel shoes do not cause the disorder but can make the condition worse.","33":"Paraphimosis is the inability to pull the foreskin back over the head of the penis after it has been retracted in an uncircumcised male. The foreskin acts as a tourniquet and decreases the blood supply to the head of the penis. Paraphimosis is a medical emergency and treatment should be sought immediately.","330":"The vocal cords are located in the larynx and vibrate to produce sounds. They also prevent food from entering the airway during swallowing. There are two cords. If both become paralyzed and remain in the closed position, the airway can become obstructed. This requires emergent treatment. If only one is weakened, patients have more problems with speech. Reasons for this disorder include: direct trauma to the cords, chest or neck surgery with an injury to the nerve supplying the cords, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and tumors.","331":"Cuts to the skin. Lacerations can be simple involving only the skin, or complex with injury to tendons, nerves and\/or blood vessels. With tendon lacerations there is weakness in the movement of the affected limb or appendage, and with nerve damage numbness is experienced beyond the laceration.","332":"The death of tissue in any part of the body, which is usually caused by decreased blood flow to the affected area. The disorder is sometimes associated with an infection. Patients with poor circulation, such as diabetics and those with atherosclerosis, are more likely to have gangrene. Any part of the body can be affected but the most common areas involve the legs and feet, arms, ears and nose.","333":"Trichinella spiralis is a nematode; a parasitic worm. Infection occurs when infected undercooked pork or wild game is eaten and viable larvae are ingested. The larvae develop into adults in the small intestine and lay eggs. The newly hatched larvae penetrate the intestinal wall and travel to muscle, thus completing their life cycle. The infection damages muscles and later on can parasite can cause heart, lung and central nervous system problems.","334":"Complex biological response of tissues to harmful stimuli, such as bacteria, viruses damaged cells, or irritants. It is a protective attempt by the body to remove the offending stimuli as well as start the healing process. Inflammatory conditions also include autoimmune diseases that represent a \"misfiring\" or abnormal regulation of the body's immune system causing it to attack its host.","335":"The vitreous gel fills the eye behind the lens. The retina is the \"film\" of the eye that detects light and is located in the back of the globe of the eye. The vitreous gel can liquefy and shrink pulling away from the retina. The vitreous gel separating from the retina is called a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). PVD is more common as one ages and with extreme nearsightedness. In general PVD does not cause a decrease in vision unless blood enters the vitreous gel (posterior vitreous hemorrhage). A small percentage of patients (3%-7%) with PVD can go on to develop a retinal detachment because the vitreous pulling away from the retina creates suction that pulls the retina away from the back of the eye where it belongs. Retinal detachment is an emergency condition that can cause permanent loss of vision if it is not treated immediately. ","336":"A sudden malfunction of the brain caused by interruption of the brain's blood supply. Hemorrhagic strokes involve rupturing of a blood vessel, with bleeding into the brain. In the more common thromboembolic strokes, the blood supply to a part of the brain suddenly stops, either from a blocked artery in the brain caused by hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) or by a blood clot that travels from another area like the heart, and lodges in a brain artery (an embolus). The symptoms experienced depend on the artery that ruptures, or is blocked. Survival and the best outcome depend on seeking medical care immediately.","337":"An inhaled foreign body will become lodged in the trachea or bronchus (air tubes of the lung). The symptoms experienced depend on where in the airway the foreign body resides. A foreign body that lodges in a larger bronchus will cause more respiratory distress. Smaller foreign bodies may not cause any symptoms initially, but if not removed the foreign body can cause an infection or partial collapse of the lung. Children can inadvertently inhale foreign bodies and initially have no complaints. Parents must have a high index of suspicion to seek care and establish the diagnosis.","338":"Finger swelling has many potential causes, including inflammation, infection, allergic reaction, or cancer. Inflammation can be caused by trauma, arthritis, or an autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.","339":"Scorpions are found across the southern United States and in many foreign countries. Symptoms depend on the type of scorpion involved. The stings are rarely fatal.","34":"An abnormal growth of cells in the testicle. There are several different types of testicular cancer. The ability to spread and cause disease in other areas of the body depends on the type. The two most common types of testicular cancer are seminoma and non-seminoma. The cancer typically only involves one testicle. This disorder is the most common form of cancer in young men, and occurs most often between ages 20-40.","340":"Lumbar spondylosis is the term used to indicate degenerative changes in the joints and discs between the vertebrae of the lower back. This arthritis usually occurs because of the age-related degenerative disease that develops in the joints and discs of the spine. All patients Everyone experiences some wear and tear of the lower back joints as we age. But some have more severe damage causing significant pain and stiffness and sometimes difficulty walking. As the arthritis develops there can be the development of bone spurs, or osteophytes. The rough edges of these bone spurs can irritate the nearby nerves, ligaments and muscles causing different types of pain. Spondylosis of the spine is one of the most common causes of pain in the elderly.","341":"Inflammation of the blood vessels. It most commonly affects children ages 18 to 24 months. The disorder affects the mucus membranes, lymph nodes, walls of the blood vessels, and the heart. Inflammation of the blood vessels of the heart can lead to aneurysms and heart attacks.","342":"During fetal development, the thyroid gland migrates from the throat to the bottom of the neck. As it moves, it can drag other throat tissue along with it. This tissue can form cysts during childhood. The cysts cause a painless mass in the middle of the neck that moves with swallowing or tongue movement. They may become infected, leading to the development of an abscess.","343":"Infection of the linings inside the heart chambers. The inside of the heart chambers and valves are lined by endocardium. Infection of this lining is called endocarditis. The valves of the heart are most commonly infected. Structurally abnormal heart valves and artificial heart valves are more likely to become infected. Bacteria, especially strep and staph species, are the most common germs that cause endocarditis.  As they multiply, tissue is damaged. Depending on the extent of damage, heart function may be affected. Intravenous drug use is a major risk factor for endocarditis. Left untreated the disorder can cause strokes, damage to other organs, and heart failure.","344":"Presence of gallstones in the common bile duct. The condition causes yellowing of the skin from elevated bilirubin and can cause liver damage. The gallstones need to be removed by ERCP or surgery.","345":"Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are problems that can affect the jaw joint or the muscles of the face used in chewing. About 20% to 30% of people have TMD symptoms. Women are more than three times as likely as men to have them. There are several types of TMDs. Most TMDs are related to sore muscles that sometimes have spasms. They can be caused by trauma to the jaw, tension, stress, poor tooth alignment (malocclusion) and arthritis or tumors of the jaw joint. Clenching or grinding of teeth and gum chewing may contribute to jaw-related problems.  ","346":"Tapeworms are parasites that take up residence in the gut. The infection is acquired by eating undercooked meat of infected animals. There are multiple different types of tapeworms with Taenia saginata usually infecting beef, and Taenia solium being found in pork. The immature worms are ingested and grow in the intestine where they can live for many years and reach 12 feet in length. Very large tapeworms can block the intestines leading to a bowel obstruction. The larvae of the pork tapeworm can invade the body, enter the blood stream and infect the brain, eyes or heart. The invasive form of the disease is called cysticercosis. ","347":"A disorder in which normal social situations cause extreme anxiety and avoidance behavior. In its mild form, it is known as \"stage fright.\" People with this disorder may go to lengths to avoid these situations and can have difficulties performing straight forward tasks such as shopping. Patients often feel embarrassment and know their anxiety reactions are abnormal.","348":"The nasal septum separates the two sides of the nose. A deviated septum is the movement of the tissue between the nostrils (septum) to one side or the other. The blockage of one air passage results in decreased airflow and over time can cause sinus infections, nosebleeds and difficulty breathing at night. A deviated septum can be present at birth, but usually results from trauma later in life.","349":"Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is the growth of abnormal immature white blood cells in the bone marrow. The bone marrow is the soft spongy material contained in the center of the bones. There are several types of white blood cells normally produced by the bone marrow. These include neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes and monocytes. The normal marrow production is replaced by production of immature cells called blasts. This over-growth of cells prevents the production of normal blood cells. The disease is more common in men, whites and older patients.","35":"A nervous system disease that attacks nerve cells called motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. These neurons enable people to control their voluntary muscles. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is also called Lou Gehrig's disease. The disease more often appears after 40 years of age and is progressive. It is more common in males. There is no known treatment and therapy is aimed at reducing the symptoms and prolonging survival. Eventually patients are no longer able to breathe and suffer respiratory failure and death. The cause of ALS is not known.","350":"Injury to the body from radiation. Radiation travels through the air and cannot be seen. Special machines called Geiger counters are needed to measure and detect the radiation. Everyone is exposed to radiation from the sun and the natural surroundings. Man-made radiation is used in x-rays, to treat cancer, for nuclear energy and as weapons. Being exposed to excess radiation over a long period of time can damage genes. Sometimes the damage can cause cancer. Higher doses of radiation cause radiation sickness. Radiation sickness causes hair loss, burns, organ damage, and can be fatal if the dose is high enough.","351":"Drug withdrawal syndrome is the group of symptoms and signs that occurs when an individual who habitually uses a drug or alcohol discontinues use. Symptoms and signs vary greatly depending on the substance discontinued and how long the substance was continually used. In some cases, the condition may be life-threatening. Drug and alcohol dependence is a significant problem.","352":"A skin rash that most commonly affects young adults. It may begin as a single red, scaly patch (herald patch). After this, small pink spots spread across the chest and abdomen, and may involve the uppers arms and upper legs or neck. The rash can be itchy. It usually lasts 6 to 8 weeks, but it can last as short as 3 weeks and occasionally longer than 2 months.","353":"Psychosis that develops shorty after childbirth, usually within 2 weeks following delivery. There is an abrupt change in the woman\u2019s thinking and behavior, such as hearing voices that are not real or having bizarre or paranoid thoughts that are not grounded in reality. Left untreated postpartum psychosis carries a significant risk of self harm and\/or harm to the newborn.","354":"Xerostomia is commonly known as dry mouth. It is a symptom or complication of many other conditions and infections. These conditions cause saliva production to decrease or stop. Xerostomia can be a side effect of medication. It is also commonly caused by a dehydration, radiation therapy or surgical removal of a salivary gland.","355":"A disorder of children caused by a low level of vitamin D, calcium, and\/or phosphate in the body. These minerals and vitamins are necessary for normal bone growth and development. Deficiency of these elements causes weakening, deformity and fractures of the bones. The most common cause of these low levels is malnutrition and a poor diet. For that reason, rickets is much more common in developing nations than in developed nations. Metabolic problems causing decreased absorption or utilization of calcium, vitamin D and\/or phosphorous may also cause the disorder.","356":"Kidneys are essential to maintain the fluid and chemistry balance in the body. Kidney failure leads to a build-up of fluid and an increase in waste products in the blood stream. One serious side effect is an elevation in the blood potassium level (hyperkalemia) which can lead to life threatening heart arrhythmias and death. There are many causes of this disorder with diabetes and high blood pressure being the most common. Unfortunately symptoms are usually not experienced until over 90% of the kidney function has been lost. This is why it is important for patients with high blood pressure and diabetes to have frequent medical check-ups.","357":"Foot swelling has many potential causes, including inflammation, infection, a blood clot (deep vein thrombosis or DVT), allergic reaction, or cancer. Inflammation can be caused by trauma, arthritis, or an autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. A back up of fluid from poor circulation can also cause foot swelling.","358":"Enthesopathy is an inflammatory condition involving structures that attach to bones, including ligaments, tendons and fascia. It can be associated with inflammatory diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and enteropathic arthritis.  Enthesopathy can affect many parts of the body, but the lowest part of the back, ankles and feet tend to be affected most often.  Males and females are affected equally. Individuals with inflammatory conditions such as reactive arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease are at greatest risk for development of enthesopathy.","359":"Encephalopathy is a term used to describe a condition that results in abnormal brain function. Encephalopathy can be short-lived or more permanent. A wide variety of medical conditions such as hypoglycemia, a brain infection, liver failure, lack of oxygen, drug use and alcoholism can result in encephalopathy. ","36":"An abnormal twisting of the intestines. The disorder can occur because of a congenital abnormality (mal-rotation of intestine) and usually presents early in life. When it occurs in adults, it more commonly involves the large intestine (colon). Regardless of the cause, the volvulus can cause obstruction of the flow of material through the bowel, variable loss of blood supply, and possible death of the colon. If untreated the disorder can be life threatening.","360":"A mass of dry, hard stool that becomes stuck in the rectum due to chronic constipation. When this mass causes blocked passage of stool it can be painful. Small amounts of watery stool sometimes can get around the impacted stool. Patients taking constipating medications (narcotics, anticholinergics, anti-diarrheal medications) and bedridden patients are increased risk of the disorder.","361":"An infection of the intestinal tract caused by the bacteria Tropheryma whippelii. The infection can spread to other parts of the body if not treated appropriately. Not everyone exposed to the bacteria becomes sick. Some researchers believe a defect in the immune system makes some patients susceptible. It is a very uncommon disease, but can be fatal if untreated. This disorder is more common in men and most often seen after age 40.","362":"Lens dislocation is the movement of the lens in the eye from its normal location. The lens is normally seated behind the iris (colored part of the eye) and focuses light onto the retina. Lens dislocation can occur spontaneously or as the result of trauma. The lens is held in place by ligaments and some people are born with naturally weak ligaments. Certain conditions (Marfan's syndrome, homocystinuria and tertiary syphilis) are associated with lens dislocation.","363":"Today the condition is known as reactive arthritis. The joint inflammation may be accompanied with a painful red eye, and\/or irritation in the urethra (the drainage tube from the bladder). This set of symptoms tends to occur after your immune system begins to react against an infection in the bowel or the pelvic organs, such as the sexually transmitted infection Chlamydia It can also occur after infectious diarrhea. It is unknown why some patients develop reactive arthritis after infections, but people who carry a gene known as HLA B27 have an increased risk. ","364":"An acute respiratory infection caused by the bacteria Corynebacterium diphtheriae. It begins by infecting the throat causing a gray-to-black, tough, fiber-like covering, which can block the airway. Involvement of the skin, heart and central nervous system can develop after the throat infection. Life threatening airway blockage and heart arrhythmias can develop. It is an extremely contagious disorder, and is spread from person to person by respiratory droplets that are released into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. After exposure to an infected person, the disease usually will develop within 2 to 5 days. It can also spread when a person has contact with an infected object or surface. The vaccine DPT (diphtheria\/pertussis\/tetanus) for children and DT (diphtheria\/tetanus) can help prevent the disease. ","365":"A traumatic hip dislocation occurs when the upper part of the thigh bone (femur) comes out of its normal location in a cup-like part of the pelvis called the acetabulum. Normally, the top of the femur rotates freely within this cup and forms a ball and socket joint. When the top of the femur comes out of the cup, the joint can no longer move freely and there is the potential for decreased blood flow to the femur. These dislocations may be the result of a falls, a contact sport injury or an automobile accident. A hip dislocation is a medical emergency and immediate medical attention is required. Ideally, the hip should be placed back in its socket within six hours to avoid a blood flow injury to the femur (avascular necrosis).","366":"A breakdown of the muscle cells. It most commonly occurs after a person has been unconscious for several hours. Lying heavily (while unconscious or intoxicated) without shifting one's weight can lead to muscle breakdown. Rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown) also occurs after extreme exercise or seizures, and can be a complication (side effect) of certain medications. Cholesterol lowering drugs named statins (atorvastatin\/Lipitor, lovastatin\/Mevacor, simvastatin\/Zocor etc.) can result in this problem. Muscle breakdown releases the protein myoglobin into the blood. Myoglobin harms the kidney and can cause kidney failure.","367":"An episode of acute depression that is the result of a stressful life event such as: loss of job, loss of a loved one, house fire, or natural catastrophe. It is unclear why some are affected and others are not. The symptoms can last days to years.","368":"A common injury from a forceful twisting of the knee causing stretching and\/or tearing of the ligaments in the knee without any broken bones. The knee joint has four major ligaments that may be injured called the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), and lateral collateral ligament (LCL). Often times during a knee sprain more than one ligament is affected. Sprains are commonly graded in a severity range from Grade I (mild) to Grade III (severe). Most mild sprains heal on their own with just rest. Severe injuries may need immobilization and\/or surgical repair.","369":"A bacterial infection involving the kidneys. It is more common in females, although it affects both genders and all ages. Kidney infections in males are more likely if the bladder does not drain easily (one cause of this problem is a large prostate.) Bladder infections are common in women, and the typical cause of a kidney infection in a female is migration of bacteria from the bladder infection. The infection travels up the tube (ureter) that drains into the bladder from the kidneys. ","37":"Steroids are medications that reduce inflammation and are used to treat many diseases from asthma to arthritis. When they are taken on a long-term basis, problematic side effects can occur including: glaucoma, cataracts, high-blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity, GERD, osteoporosis, muscle atrophy, increased infections, and Cushing syndrome.","370":"Dilated veins, similar to varicose veins, that are found in the anal canal (internal hemorrhoids), or at the anal opening (external hemorrhoids). They are often chronic and become a problem when they bleed, become painful, develop a blood clot or enlarge. Hemorrhoids may be more likely to develop if you have been pregnant or tend to sit for prolonged periods, or have constipation, liver disease (cirrhosis), or infections of the anal canal. In general, internal hemorrhoids bleed but are not painful. External hemorrhoids are more likely to be painful but usually do not bleed as much as internal hemorrhoids.","371":"A condition in which the heart's aortic valve narrows. The aortic valve separates the heart from the aorta. When the heart pumps, blood is pushed through the aortic valve into the aorta and to the rest of the body. The aortic valve closes when the heart relaxes preventing blood from flowing backward into the heart. The narrowing prevents the valve from opening fully, obstructing blood flow from the heart into the aorta and onward to the rest of the body.","372":"A physical and mental dependence on alcohol, sometimes resulting in chronic disease and the loss of interpersonal, family and work relationships. Continued daily use can result in permanent damage to the liver (cirrhosis). Other long term effects include: anemia, internal bleeding, impaired thinking, confusion, coma, multiple cancers, and premature death. ","373":"Advance stage of preeclampsia. Preeclampsia (toxemia) is a condition of pregnancy marked by high blood pressure, protein in the urine, and swelling of the feet and hands. Eclampsia is preeclampsia along with seizures, a condition that may be fatal. Preeclampsia and eclampsia are seen after the 20th week of pregnancy. The following increase the risk of having preeclampsia and eclampsia: teenage pregnancy, previous history of preeclampsia, obesity, carrying more than one baby (twins, triplets etc.), having high blood pressure, age greater than 35, and being of African American descent. This condition is serious and requires immediate treatment.","374":"A hip dislocation occurs when the upper part of the thigh bone (femur) comes out of its normal location in the cup-like part of the pelvis called the acetabulum. Normally, the top of the femur rotates freely within this cup and forms a ball and socket joint. When the top of the femur comes out of the cup, the joint can no longer move freely and there is the potential for decreased blood flow to the femur. Dislocations may be the result of trauma such as an automobile accident. However, individuals who have had a hip replacement are at risk to experience dislocations without trauma. This can happen with motions such as a deep squat or extreme rotation of the hip. A hip dislocation is a medical emergency and immediate medical attention is required. Ideally, the hip should be placed back in its socket within six hours to avoid blood flow injury to the femur, which could cause avascular necrosis. ","375":"Cancer that develops in the large intestine (colon). Colon cancer can develop from certain types of benign polyps, called adenomas. Colon cancer usually grows slowly, but it may reach a very large size. The cancer can obstruct the intestinal tract and\/or spread to nearby organs, especially the liver. Detection of these cancers is readily done through colonoscopy. The earlier polyps and these cancers are detected the more likely the patient will survive the disease. Colon cancer is uncommon in patients less than 50. Besides advancing age, risk factors for this disorder include: inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease); family history of colon cancer or adenomas, especially familial adenomatous polyposis. Ethnic heritage may also play a role, as the disease is highest in Alaska natives and lowest in Hispanics and Filipinos.","376":"Eyelid lacerations can be superficial or deep. Deep lacerations involving the tarsal plate require repair. Eyelid lacerations that extend through the lid margin also require repair.","377":"Carbon monoxide poisoning can be a life threatening problem. The disorder occurs when one breathes too much carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is a gas produced by burning any type of fuel-gas, oil, kerosene, wood, or charcoal. Faulty house heaters, poor ventilation, holes in mufflers, and building fires are common causes of exposure. This poisoning is especially dangerous for pregnant women since the unborn baby is susceptible to the damaging effects of carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide prevents a patient's cells from using oxygen normally which leads to cardiac and nervous system problems.","378":"The digestive tract begins with the mouth and includes esophagus, stomach, small and large intestine, and ends at the anus. Bleeding may occur anywhere along this pathway and may be visible in vomit or in the stool. The bleeding can be slow and persistent causing anemia and black stools (melena) or fast and extensive resulting in bright red blood in the stool and dizziness. Rapid gastrointestinal bleeding can be a life threatening illness. ","379":"The retina is pulled away from the back of the eye (choroid) causing the cells of the retina to lose their blood supply. The retina is the \"film\" of the eye that allows light to be detected and is necessary for proper sight. The longer the retina stays detached the more likely permanent damage and permanent loss of vision will occur. Early diagnosis and treatment can save the vision of the eye. The most common causes of this disorder include: trauma, diabetes, and inflammation of the eye and aging of the jelly-like fluid in front of the retina (the vitreous). Retinal detachment is more common in patients over 40, those with a family history of the disease, and in extreme near sightedness. ","38":"Inflammation of the tip of the penis (glans). It occurs most commonly in uncircumcised men with inadequate hygiene or poorly controlled diabetes. The inflammation is often due to a yeast infection. Also it can be caused by harsh soaps or failure to properly rinse soap off while bathing. Less commonly it is related to reactive arthritis or lichen sclerosis et atrophicus.","380":"A fever is the body's way of reacting to something abnormal in the body. Fevers, on their own, aren't bad for you unless they become too high or last too long though they can make you feel awful. The cause of the fever is the bigger concern. Fevers may help the body fight infections but that should not prevent a patient from trying to lower the temperature. Fevers can be caused by a number of conditions including: infections, reactions to medications, reactions to blood transfusions, cancer, or autoimmune diseases.","381":"Thrombophlebitis is a clot in a vein that is superficial (near the surface) and associated with inflammation of the vein. It is common in people with varicose veins but can occur in any situation where the blood flow is sluggish (pregnancy, immobilization). Intravenous drug abusers and people who require intravenous medications are at increased risk for this condition. ","382":"A birth defect and disease of infants in which nerve cells in the wall of the large intestine do not develop. These nerve cells control the muscle contractions of the intestines. Without proper muscle contractions (peristalsis) fecal material does pass through the intestines causing obstruction and dilation of the large intestine (colon).","383":"Meralgia paresthetica is a painful nerve condition. In this condition, the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (sensory nerve on the outside of the thigh) is compressed and causes pain, numbness and tingling in the upper outer thigh.  Causes of compression may include pregnancy, tight clothing, obesity and long term tool or duty belt wear. Removing the cause usually treats the condition.","384":"A congenital abnormality consisting of failure of all or part of the vagina to develop as well as lack of development of the uterus and fallopian tubes. The disorder occurs in 1 in 4000-5000 women and is the second most common cause of primary amenorrhea (no menstruation). The ovaries that produce estrogen and other female hormones are present and the outward appearance of the affected women is otherwise normal. The disorder is usually diagnosed when a patient presents in her teenage years with a failure to start menstruating. Surgery can usually improve the symptoms of painful sexual intercourse but most patients are not able to become pregnant. Experimental uterine transplant procedures are being investigated in Europe.","385":"An over-stretched or torn ligament. Any joint may be involved, but sprains are most common in the ankles, knees or fingers. Sprained joints have normal function except for decrease movement secondary to pain. Sprains cause pain, swelling and bruising of the affected joint. A strain is a stretched or torn muscle. ","386":"Small oval non-flying insects the size of apple seeds. They hide in the cracks and crevices of beds, in the box springs of beds, under peeling paint, under carpets, in the upholstery seams of furniture, and under light switches or outlets. They come out at night and feed by sucking the blood of humans or animals. People are more likely to acquire bed bugs if they sleep in hotels or shelters. Bed bugs can be difficult to remove and may require a professional exterminator.","387":"The forearm is the area of the body between the elbow and the wrist. The forearm is made up of two bones called the radius and ulna. A forearm fracture is a common fracture for all age groups and usually occurs due to direct trauma, such as falling on the arm. Treatment depends on the location, severity of the injury and age of the patient. The fracture can damage adjacent nerves and blood vessels.","388":"Disorder occurs when one or both testicles fail to move down into the scrotum (the sac next to the penis) before birth. Cryptorchidism is also called undescended testicle. It occurs in 3% of male births. It is more common in premature births. Most cases resolve on their own, but at times surgery is needed.","389":"An inherited blood disorder that causes low numbers of red blood cells (anemia). Hemoglobin is a substance in the red blood cells that carries oxygen and consists of two proteins, alpha globulin and beta globulin, plus iron. Alpha thalassemia occurs when not enough alpha globulin is made, and beta thalassemia when not enough beta globulin is made. These defects cause the premature destruction of the red blood cells leading to anemia. Thalassemia is inherited and alpha thalassemia is seen most often in people of southeast Asia, the Middle East, China, and African descent. While beta thalassemia is more frequent in people from the Mediterranean. There are two further classifications: major and minor. Major is more serious and occurs when a patient inherits a thalassemia gene from each parent. Minor is less severe, many times not needing treatment, and occurs when only one gene is inherited. Complications of thalassemia major include: bone deformities, enlarged spleen, stunted growth, iron overload, and heart failure.","39":"A sudden stoppage of blood flow to the blood vessels of the brain causing injury. In a thrombotic stroke, a clot forms inside the blood vessel and eventually completely blocks blood flow. The symptoms experienced depend on the area of the brain that is affected. Survival and the best outcome depend on seeking medical care immediately. These types of strokes are more common in patients with high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol and those that smoke cigarettes.","390":"Spina bifida is the incomplete closure of the spinal canal that occurs during fetal development (growth of the child during pregnancy). The incomplete closure may be a simple opening in the bones of the spinal column (spina bifida occulta), a protrusion of the covering of the spinal cord (meningocele) or a protrusion of the spinal cord itself (myelomeningocele). The chance of getting spina bifida is greatly reduced if the pregnant mother consumes an adequate amount of folic acid.","391":"Traumatic brain injury is the disruption of normal brain function resulting from head trauma. In order to be classified as traumatic brain injury, individuals must experience a loss of consciousness at the time of injury, memory loss, confusion or stroke like symptoms. These symptoms can be temporary or permanent. Motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause of traumatic brain injury and it is not surprising that alcohol use is associated with an increased risk of traumatic brain injury. Men are twice as likely as women to experience traumatic brain injury.","392":"An inflammation of the tissue lining the eyelids (conjunctiva) due to an allergic reaction. The most common allergens are pollen and dander. The conjunctivas become red, swollen, and itchy. Excessive tearing.","393":"Facial trauma can be penetrating (gunshot wound or stabbing) or blunt (motor vehicle accident or fall). The injury can result in fractures, nerve injury, eye injury, nasal injury or lacerations with bleeding. Fractures of the jaw cause decreased motion, and orbit fractures can result in impaired vision.","394":"A mental state or chronic mental disorder characterized by feelings of sadness, loneliness, despair, helplessness, low self-esteem, and self-reproach. Other signs include psychomotor retardation (lack of energy or imitative), agitation, withdrawal from social contact, insomnia, decreased appetite and\/or a vegetative state. The symptoms can be severe and lead to self harm or suicide.","395":"It is normal for the placenta to separate from the uterus after childbirth. It is not normal for the placenta to separate before childbirth. This is called placental abruption. The fetus receives oxygen and nutrients through the placenta and an abruption can be life-threatening for the fetus and the mother. Placenta abruption can lead to preterm birth, low birth weight, and major maternal blood loss. Abruptions can be spontaneous or can occur after trauma.","396":"An autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). Nerve cells normally are surrounded by an insulating sheath made of a fatty substance called myelin that helps to transmit nerve impulses. In MS, this myelin sheath is inflamed or damaged. This disrupts or slows nerve impulses and causes nerves to malfunction. Scarring (sclerosis) occurs in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord. These areas of myelin damage and scarring are called MS plaques. The disease periodically flares up with episodes of increased symptoms. The disease can be mild, and non-progressive disease, can slowly get worse, or get worse rapidly. It is slightly more common in women between the ages of 20 to 40.","397":"An abnormal collection of arteries and veins within the kidney. The causes are either congenital or acquired. The most common acquired cause is abnormal healing after a medical procedure. The first sign of this abnormality may be blood in the urine (hematuria). Hypertension and flank pain is commonly associated with the disorder.","398":"A rectocele is an area of weakness in the wall of tissue that separates the vagina from the rectum. As the wall weakens, the rectum bulges into the vagina causing symptoms. The risk of developing a rectocele increases with multiple births, chronic constipation, chronic cough and repetitive heavy lifting. Rectoceles are most common in older women.","399":"A yellow color in the skin, the mucous membranes, and the eyes. Jaundice is not a disease but a sign of disease and it has many causes. The yellow discoloration is caused by an elevation of bilirubin. Bilirubin is produced from the breakdown of red blood cells and is processed in the liver and stored in the gall bladder. Elevation occurs for many reasons, including: blockage of the bile ducts, liver disease, or increased production of bilirubin secondary to abnormal breakdown of red blood cells. Jaundice is common in the newborn and sometimes treated with the application of special lights (phototherapy).","4":"Cyclospora is a parasite that causes diarrhea, nausea and abdominal cramping. Patients become infected by ingesting food or water contaminated with the parasite. The Cyclospora parasite is very small having only one cell, and it can only be diagnosed by using a special test of a stool sample. Patients with normal immune systems will usually recover without definitive treatment although the symptoms can last up to a month. Those with weakened immune systems or those in poor health can have more serious symptoms including dehydration requiring hospital admission. ","40":"A diverticulum is an outpouching of the colon that develops as one ages. Diverticulitis occurs when the opening of these pouches become blocked and get inflamed or infected. The pain is in the lower abdomen and more likely on the left. If severe, the diverticulum can perforate and lead to a life threatening infection.","400":"A collection of blood within the scrotum. The most common causes are trauma and surgery. Most will resolve without treatment.","401":"Tinnitus is the sensation of hearing a sound when there is no external sound. The sound can be described as a ringing, buzzing or hissing. Tinnitus can occur for a variety of reasons including exposure to a loud noise, hearing loss associated with aging, inner ear trauma, wax build up, Meniere's disease, a brain tumor called acoustic neuroma, and medications. In some cases the cause cannot be determined.  ","402":"A swelling of the eyelid caused by a swollen oil gland. It can be the after-effect of a sty. ","403":"Clouding of the lens of the eye. Normally, light that enters the eye passes through a clear lens and falls on the retina, in the back of the eye. When the lens is clouded, this decreases vision. Most cataracts develop slowly as one gets older. Trauma to the eye and congenital abnormalities can cause the cataract to form more quickly. The following conditions can increase the likelihood of developing a cataract: smoking, corticosteroid medications, diabetes, high blood pressure, alcoholism, exposure to sunlight without wearing glasses, obesity, previous eye injury or eye disease, and a family history of cataracts.","404":"Type 1 diabetes is a disease in which the body does not make enough insulin to control blood sugar levels. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas and helps to regulate blood sugar levels. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. It is most commonly diagnosed in children and teens. It was previously called juvenile diabetes. At times the first sign of type 1 diabetes is a life threatening complication called diabetic ketoacidosis.","405":"Bacteria that live in the nose and throat of 5%-10% of the population without causing any problems. However, serious infections can occur if N. meningitidis gets into the blood stream after penetrating the mucous membranes of the nose and throat. The infection can result in pneumonia and\/or meningitis. Meningitis is an infection of the membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord and can be rapidly fatal if untreated. There is a vaccine that can prevent the disease. The CDC recommends all 11-12 year olds receive the vaccine and a booster after 16 years of age.","406":"A twisting of the ovary where it is attached to its blood supply, causing decreased blood supply. If ovarian torsion is not quickly treated, areas of dead tissue (gangrene) in the ovary can result and this can cause dangerous inflammation. Torsion is more likely if the ovary has developed a cyst. It is more common in women less than 30.","407":"Defined as an increase in total body fat, or at least a 20% increase in one's ideal body weight. Obesity has increased in frequency in the last 20 years and it is estimated 33% of Americans are obese. One calculation of obesity is the body mass index or BMI. \r\nTo calculate the BMI, people take their weight in pounds and multiplies it by 705, then divides this number by their height in inches, then divides this number again by their height in inches. The US Department of Health and Human Services provides a BMI calculator at http:\/\/www.nhlbisupport.com\/bmi\/. A normal BMI = 18.5-24.9; overweight = 25.0-29.9; obese = 30 or greater; and morbidly obese = 40 or greater. \r\n\r\nObesity is the second leading cause of preventable death (after smoking), and is associated with type 2 diabetes, elevated cholesterol, heart disease, arthritis, gallstones, obstructive sleep apnea, and cancer. There are many causes of obesity from genetic to environmental factors, and certain conditions including Cushing's syndrome, hypothyroidism and medications, such as steroids, can cause obesity. In the great majority of cases no secondary cause is determined.","408":"The vocal cords are located in the larynx and vibrate to produce sounds. They also prevent food from entering the airway during swallowing. Vocal cord nodules are fibrous or inflammatory small growths that develop on the vocal cords. They most often occur from overuse of the vocal cords, and are sometimes called screamer's nodule, singer's nodule and teacher's nodule.","409":"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory illness caused by a type of coronavirus. It was first found and reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The cause or the source of the virus is unknown, but it is thought that it likely originated from an animal source. MERS has been shown to spread between people who are in close contact. The first case of MERS was detected in the US in a traveler from Saudi Arabia in May of 2014, but is most commonly found in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. The CDC continues to closely monitor the MERS situation globally to better understand how it spreads, the source and risks to the public's health. According to the CDC approximately 1 in 4 infected people die from MERS. ","41":"A bleeding disorder that may be caused by one of several blood clotting factor deficiencies. Classic Hemophilia, or Hemophilia A, is caused by a deficiency of factor VIII. Hemophilia B, (Christmas disease), occurs with a deficiency of factor IX. These diseases are usually genetic and usually occur only in males. Due to mutations, new cases can arise in families with no history of the disorder. Hemophilia can cause dangerous episodes of bleeding.","410":"The walls of blood vessels are damaged by inflammation. The arteries are primarily involved leading to decrease blood flow. This decreased blood flow causes the damage and symptoms experienced. Vasculitis can involve large or small blood vessels in any area of the body. Examples of vasculitis include giant cell arteritis, temporal arteritis, ANCA positive vasculitis (granulomatosis with polyangiitis), and small vessel vasculitis (Henoch-Schonlein purpura, lupus).","411":"A condition or disease caused by an over active immune system attacking the body's own tissues and organs. Prominent examples include celiac disease, diabetes mellitus type 1, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, multiple sclerosis (MS), Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).","412":"The prostate gland is located below the bladder and it surrounds the urethra (the bladder's drainage tube). Prostate cancer is very common men over 60. Although a blood test (prostate specific antigen) can detect cancer in an early stage, screening for this cancer and treating it early might cause more harm than good. (Too many men have complications from treatment to make it sensible to treat all cancers that are in an early stage). The US Preventative Services Task Force recommends against having screening tests for prostate cancer. Prostate cancer that is advanced can metastasize and cause death.","413":"Dysarthria is slurred speech caused by weakness of the muscles of the face, mouth and\/or throat. This symptom requires immediate medical attention if it happens suddenly. The following conditions can cause this disorder: stroke, head injury, alcohol intoxication, drug overdose, low blood sugar, Parkinson's disease, mini stroke (transient ischemic attack\/TIA), brain tumor, cerebral palsy, or a brain infection","414":"The esophagus is the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. Spasm is a disorder of the motility of the esophagus characterized by excessive and abnormal contractions which prevents normal movement of food down the esophagus. Very hot or cold foods can trigger the symptoms.","415":"The most common causes of mouth swelling are trauma, infections, and allergic reactions.","416":"Elapids are snakes including cobras, kraits, mambas, coral, tiger, and Australian snakes. Elapids have neurotoxic venom (nerve poison), which acts mainly on the central nervous system. The venom affects heart function and breathing but may cause little or no damage at the bite site.","417":"Repeated fabrication of symptoms and complaints that mimic disease for the purpose of gaining medical attention. Many patients wander from hospital to hospital feigning acute medical or surgical illness and give false information about their medical and social background for no apparent reason other than to gain attention. These patients can experience significant adverse effects from the medical tests and surgical procedures performed.","418":"A disease of the blood forming tissues in bone marrow characterized by the over-production of white blood cells. There are multiple types including: acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and hairy cell leukemia. The severity of the disease depends on the cell type and whether it is the acute or chronic form.","419":"A cut on the leg. Lacerations of the leg can be simple involving only the skin or complex with injury to tendons, nerves and\/or blood vessels. With tendon lacerations, there may be weakness in the part of the extremity (ankle, foot or toe) normally moved by the tendon, and with nerve damage, numbness is experienced beyond the laceration.\n","42":"Parathyroid cancer is a rare cancer of the parathyroid glands. There are four parathyroid glands and they surround the thyroid gland in the front of the neck. The cancerous cells may cause an increase in the amount of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the body. This results in increased calcium blood levels and related symptoms such as bone pain, kidney stones, weakness and confusion. The cancer usually occurs in individuals in their 50's and 60's.","420":"Jellyfish are marine animals with long tentacles. These tentacles have stingers that can release venom when they touch the skin. Most stings occur when people accidentally swim into the jellyfish or step on them on the beach. The main types of jellyfish are box jellyfish, Portuguese man-of-war, sea nettles and Lion's mane jellyfish. The majority of stings cause local skin pain, redness and swelling. Patients stung by the box jellyfish should seek immediate medical help since these reactions can be severe and can rarely be fatal. The dangerous species of box jellyfish are found in the Indian ocean and the Pacific ocean of Indonesia.","421":"Huntington disease is an uncommon inherited disorder that causes deterioration of nerve cells in the brain. Over time it leads to progressive mental deterioration, loss of muscle control and ultimately death. Symptoms typically begin between ages 35 and 50 but can begin at any time. The symptoms are always progressive. Men and women are affected equally. Genetic testing can confirm the presence of the gene responsible for causing Huntington disease. ","422":"Irritated fifth cranial causing severe, fleeting episodes of facial pain. Lightly touching the face can cause shooting pain. Most often no underlying cause is found. Sometimes it is related to multiple sclerosis, a tumor, or pressure on the nerve. It occurs more frequently in older women.","423":"An infection of the hip joint, usually caused by bacteria. The bacteria can enter the joint by traveling through the blood or by direct entrance into the joint from trauma. The infection can cause permanent destruction of the joint if left untreated. Previous joint surgery or a depressed immune system increases the risk of the disorder. ","424":"The esophagus is the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. Esophagitis is inflammation of the lining of the esophagus. This inflammation may be due to an infection, radiation, irritation from acid reflux, or other irritants. The most common cause is the back up of acidic fluid from the stomach - a syndrome call GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease).","425":"Occurs when the feet are wet for long periods of time. It is more common when a person has been standing or sitting. It also is more common if the shoes are too tight. The temperature does not have to be cold for this to occur. It can be quite painful, but it can be prevented and treated. Trench foot also is known as immersion foot.","426":"Also called Type 1 complex regional pain syndrome. A disorder that causes chronic pain, tenderness, sweating and swelling of the affected area. The arms and legs are most often involved. The exact cause of this disorder is not known but is thought to involve damage to the nerves resulting in the symptoms experienced. Complex regional pain syndrome usually occurs after an injury or surgery to the area. There are two types: in Type 1, there is no obvious injury to the nerve can be identified; In Type 2 an injury to the nerve has occurred. Most people suffer from Type 1. Type 1 previously was called reflex sympathetic dystrophy, and Type 2 previously was called causalgia.","427":"A bacterial cause of non-gonococcal urethritis in men. It is unclear whether it causes acute illness in women. It may be related to preterm labor in some pregnant women and potentially female infertility. ","428":"A stab wound to the eyelid. These wounds can damage structures deep to the skin such as the eye, bone, or brain. The object that caused the wound can carry bacteria or foreign material deep into the wound and cause infections. Puncture wounds from animal or human bites are especially prone to infections. ","429":"A potentially serious sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep causing dangerously low oxygen levels in the blood during the night. The low oxygen can result in hypertension, stroke and heart failure. Obstructive sleep apnea is caused by airway obstruction during the night and results from large tonsils\/adenoids and\/or obesity. More than 12 million people in the United States have obstructive sleep apnea. ","43":"Anxiety episodes that are experienced as physical symptoms. The physical symptoms are frightening but they are not dangerous. It can be difficult to recognize that the symptoms are from anxiety, and a medical evaluation to check for other explanations for the symptoms is appropriate. Up to 2% of the population have panic disorder (panic attacks). Episodes typically last from 2 to 10 minutes, but can be as long as 1-2 hours. Some people with panic attacks avoid locations or activities that have seemed to trigger previous attacks. This habit of avoiding triggers is called \"agoraphobia\" and this behavior can be extreme enough to interfere with usual life.","430":"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the growth of abnormal white blood cells called lymphocytes in the bone marrow. The bone marrow is the soft spongy material contained in the center of the bones. There are several types of white blood cells normally produced by the bone marrow. These include neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes and monocytes. In this disease, the bone marrow makes more than the usual number of immature and more mature lymphocytes and releases them into the blood stream. The disease is slow in onset and progression. It is the most common form of leukemia in adults in the Western world.","431":"Scleritis is an inflammation of the white part of the eye called the sclera. It is caused by another disease process 50% of the time. It can be caused by a variety of diseases such as auto-immune disorders (lupus, rheumatoid arthritis) and sarcoidosis. Scleritis most often occurs in individuals between thirty and sixty years old and can result in visual loss if left untreated. ","432":"A type of vasculitis that involves inflammation and narrowing of medium sized arteries. The name has been changed to granulomatosis with polyangiitis. It most often affects and damages the kidneys, lungs, and upper respiratory tract. The cause of the disease is not known. Left untreated the disorder is life threatening due to severe lung injury and \/or kidney failure. This disease is more often seen in adults greater than 35 years old.","433":"Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is death caused by cardiac arrest. During SCD, the heart stops pumping blood around the body. A person promptly loses consciousness. If the pumping of the heart is not restored within 4 minutes, the brain will die. The most common reason for SCD is a myocardial infarction (heart attack) that leads to a fast irregular heartbeat. ","434":"Diarrhea characterized as frequent loose stools, often with blood and mucus. The diarrhea is caused by inflammation of the large intestine secondary to a bacterial infection. The most common bacteria causing this infection are shigella, salmonella, and campylobacter. The infection is usually acquired by eating spoiled food or infected water.","435":"A cancerous growth that arises in a place beyond the original site of the cancer. The original cancer is called the primary tumor and the sites of metastasis are named secondary tumors. The cancer cells of the metastatic tumors have exactly the same appearance as the primary tumor. Metastatic cancers cells can spread by traveling through the blood stream, by using the lymph channels, or by spreading within the abdominal cavity. ","436":"Dog bites can become infected if not treated appropriately but are less likely to become infected than cat bites. If the dog was large the bite can cause significant injuries to nerves, blood vessels, tendons and even break bones. Dog bites of the neck can potentially be life threatening.","437":"This is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in the United States and is caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. The bacteria infect the urine canal (urethra) of men and women and the cervix of women. Most patients with this condition do not have any symptoms and can pass the disease to their sexual partners without knowing it. Chlamydia spreads through unprotected sexual contact with an infected person, and can also be spread from an infected mother to child during birth. Untreated Chlamydia infections can spread to a woman's fallopian tubes and uterus causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can result in chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancies. ","438":"A lung infection (pneumonia) caused by a fungus called Pneumocystis jiroveci (originally called Pneumocystis carinii). This fungus typically only causes disease in patients with depressed immune systems such as patients with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or those receiving chemotherapy. Some patients with weakened immune systems are placed on antibiotics to prevent the disease. ","439":"A partial or complete laceration of the tendon. Tendons connect muscles to bones and enable movement of the extremity. The most common cause of a tendon laceration is a cut that extends through the skin injuring the underlying tendon.","44":"Dry air nasal irritation can result in nasal bleeding (epistaxis) and nasal pain.","440":"A disease caused by four related viruses (arboviruses) spread by the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. Dengue fever cannot be spread directly from person to person. Dengue fever is being seen more in world travelers visiting: Southeast Asia, Indonesian archipelago into northeastern Australia, Sub-Saharan Africa, or South and Central America. It generally lasts 1-2 weeks, and is not deadly. It should not be confused with Dengue hemorrhagic fever which is a different disease and can be deadly. ","441":"Iron is a mineral and is found in many vitamin supplements particularly prenatal vitamins. Accidental and intentional ingestions can result in significant toxicity and death. This disorder is one of the leading causes of overdose deaths in children. Patients with an iron overdose initially experience gastrointestinal complaints such as vomiting and abdominal pain due to the corrosive effects of the iron.","442":"Two inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition of the bowel often affecting the lowest portion of the small intestine called the ileum. Other portions of the large and small intestine may become inflamed with normal areas in between involved areas. The entire thickness of the bowel is affected and the diseased bowel can become attached to the surrounding organs causing abnormal connections between them (fistulas). Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the bowel affecting the large intestine. Only the inner lining of the intestine is inflamed and the rectum is the most commonly involved area. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have a higher incidence of intestinal cancer. Both diseases tend to run in families but their cause is unknown.","443":"An inherited disease that affects the cells that make mucous, sweat and digestive juices. The disorder causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs and digestive tract. It is one of the most common chronic lung diseases in children and affects 1 in 3000 people. Before modern treatments were available, it was common for affected children to die during their teenage years. However, early identification and better treatment has allowed many people with this disease to live well into adulthood and beyond 50. Most patients die from lung infections and lung failure.","444":"Canker sores are painful, round mouth sores. They show up in several places around the mouth, cheeks, tongue, lips, and gums. They are also known as aphthous stomatitis. Canker sores often run in families. They also are linked with certain diseases. The cause is unknown, but canker sores have several common triggers. These include emotional stress, menstruation, mouth injury and certain foods, such as citrus or acidic foods. Canker sores are not contagious. They are often confused with cold sores, which are caused by a virus.","445":"A skin disease that is caused by a virus that results in multiple, small, painless, and pearly bumps. The bumps can appear on any skin surface besides the palms and soles of the feet and often have a central crater. The disease may spread by skin-to-skin contact. All age groups are susceptible to the virus, but it is more common in children. The condition is not serious and generally goes away on its own. The disease is also seen in individuals with HIV. In those individuals, the bumps often do not resolve and can increase in size and number due to immune suppression. ","446":"The esophagus is the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. An esophageal web is a thin, fibrous, mucous membrane that forms across the esophagus. This disorder is also sometimes called an esophageal ring. It is the most common esophageal abnormality. The Schatzki's ring is one common form. The web can cause esophageal obstruction and swallowing problems. However, most patients with an esophageal web have no symptoms.","447":"A complication of chronic alcohol use if a person suddenly stops drinking. It is characterized by excessive agitation, confusion, and hallucinations. There is a release in adrenalin and other catecholamines after a sudden deprivation of alcohol. Not all alcoholics experience DTs when they stop drinking alcohol, but recurrence of DTs is common. If left untreated DTs can result in death.","448":"A stab wound in or on the ear. These wounds can damage structures deep to the skin such as bone or brain. The object that caused the wound can carry bacteria or foreign material deep into the wound and cause infections. Puncture wounds from animal or human bites are especially prone to infections. ","449":"Snake bites that do not contain poisonous venom. The bites can cause damage to the skin, soft tissue, nerves, tendons and muscles. Infection can also be the result.","45":"Inflammation of the pericardial sac, an occasional complication of a heart attack or heart surgery. The pericardial sac surrounds the heart. The inflammation is thought to be secondary to an abnormal immune response, and usually develops several weeks or months after heart tissue injury.","450":"The patella tendon attaches the patella to the lower leg (tibia) and is essential for straightening the leg. A tendon is the fibrous tissue that attaches muscle to bone in the human body. Rupture can occur from a sudden forceful straightening of the leg, from a direct blow to the tendon, or from a penetrating injury such as a laceration.","451":"If both ankles are swollen, possibilities include abnormal veins (venous insufficiency), heart failure, kidney disease, advanced liver disease. If only one ankle is swollen, causes to consider are ankle sprain, other ankle injury, a blood clot in a vein (deep vein thrombosis), infection, gout, and other joint inflammation.","452":"Small worms that live in the intestine and crawl out of the anus to lay eggs on the skin around the rectum. Pinworm infection is the most common type of roundworm infection in the United States. The infection is most commonly seen in school aged children. Many times other household members will be infected. Infection typically occurs when people unknowingly touch pinworm eggs and then touch their mouth ingesting the eggs. ","453":"This condition occurs when a part of a bone dies because of a decreased blood supply. The dead bone is weak, which can lead the bone to break. The hip is the most commonly affected area followed by the shoulders and knees. The main causes of this condition are trauma, alcohol use, and taking steroid medications. This condition is also called aseptic necrosis.","454":"An inherited, autoimmune disease in which the lining of the small intestine is damaged from eating gluten and other proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and oats. The disease causes diarrhea, malabsorption, steatorrhea, nutritional and vitamin deficiencies, and in children can result in failure to thrive and short stature. This disorder is more common in patients who have Type 1 diabetes, autoimmune disorders, microscopic colitis, lactose intolerance, Down syndrome, and intestinal cancer. Avoiding foods with gluten allows the intestine to heal but it can take months or even years for complete resolution of symptoms.\r\n","455":"Retinopathy is damage to the retina of the eye. The retina is a film-like membrane inside the eye that is a crucial component of sight. Retinopathy can be caused by a variety of conditions including diabetes, high blood pressure, sickle cell disease, radiation and prematurity. ","456":"Prediabetes is a condition that increases the likelihood of development of type II diabetes, stroke and heart disease. In this condition, blood glucose levels (blood sugar) are higher than normal but do not meet the criteria for diagnosing diabetes. Individuals over forty-five who are overweight and sedentary have an increased risk of developing prediabetes.","457":"Inflammation of the ear drum (tympanic membrane) caused by a bacterial or viral infection. This uncommon disorder is a particular type of middle ear infection that causes painful pimples (vesicles) on the ear drum. It can be seen in people with Streptococcus pneumoniae, mycoplasma or viral infections. ","458":"Dermatofibromas are small non-cancerous growths on the skin. They are firm and often feel like there is a stone underneath the skin. They are rarely larger than a half-inch in size and are pink, gray, red or brown in color. They are rare in children. The cause of dermatofibromas is unknown.","459":"A pouch that develops in the lining of the lower throat. With swallowing, some food enters the pouch. Food can sit in the pouch for many hours. This can cause bad breath, contents to spill into the lungs leading to aspiration pneumonia and\/or spitting up undigested food. Pills can also become lodged in the pouch. The disorder is rare and generally occurs in people over age 50.","46":"A collection of pus in or around an infected tonsil. The swelling can become large enough to interfere with breathing. Surgical drainage of the abscess is required. This problem can occur after strep throat infection.","460":"An overuse injury seen in children causing pain and tenderness just below the knee in the front of the lower leg. It is more common in 11-14 year old children, especially boys. The patellar (knee cap) tendon repeatedly and forcibly straightening the knee leads to swelling and tenderness in the tibial bone (shinbone).","461":"One of the most common causes of diarrhea in the United States, affecting over one million people every year. People usually get infected by eating or drinking contaminated food or water, often raw poultry, fresh produce, or unpasteurized milk. A person can also be infected by close contact with an infected person or animal. Symptoms begin 2-4 days after infection and generally last one week.","462":"This condition occurs when then bone dies because of a decreased blood supply. The dead bone is weak and small fractures can occur causing the symptoms experienced. The hip is the most commonly affected area followed by the shoulders and knees. The main causes of this condition are trauma, alcohol use, and taking corticosteroid medications. This condition is also called avascular necrosis. ","463":"Erythema multiforme is a type of skin rash that has a characteristic target appearance with round, red borders and central clearing. It can occur as a reaction to certain medications, especially antibiotics such as sulfa drugs, or to infections, such as herpes simplex. The rash usually resolves on its own, but it may recur. Some people have frequent episodes. Erythema multiforme can sometimes be associated with a systemic illness called Stevens-Johnson syndrome.","464":"Cut of the ear. The injury can involve only the skin or be more complicated injuring the underlying cartilage. If the cartilage is damaged it will need to be repaired to achieve the best cosmetic appearance. ","465":"An injury to the brain following trauma. Concussion occurs after head trauma and results in headache, confusion, loss of consciousness or other neurologic symptoms without any abnormality on a CT scan. Second impact syndrome occurs when a second concussion takes place before the first resolves and can result in severe or persistent symptoms.","466":"Fallopian tube cancer is the growth of abnormal cells inside the tube between the ovary and the uterus (fallopian tube). These abnormal cells increase in number and grow to produce a tumor, which can cause pain and vaginal bleeding. The cancer is rare. Fallopian tube cancer can start in the ovary and spread to the tube. This is often associated with inherited BRCA mutations. The cancer can also begin in the tube and spread to the ovary. Fewer of these appear to be linked to BRCA1.","467":"Bone marrow fails to produce red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Although the process is usually slow, there are instances where it may occur in a very short period of time. The inadequate number of white cells leaves the body prone to infection. Inadequate red cells limit the transportation of oxygen to cells and insufficient numbers of platelets may produce uncontrollable bleeding.","468":"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of rare inherited disorders that result in an enzyme deficiency involved in the making of cortisol, aldosterone, or both hormones.  In about 90% of cases the deficient enzyme is 21-hydroxylase.The most common form of CAH will present with abnormal genitalia at birth in females or early puberty in a toddler boy. If controlled with proper medication, people usually will have good outcomes and overall health. CHA occurs in children at the rate of 1 in 10,000 - 18,000 births.","469":"Beneath the skin and muscle of the abdominal wall, the organs of the abdomen are covered by a lining called the peritoneum. Inflammation or infection of this lining is peritonitis. The most common cause is a rupture in the gastrointestinal tract. For example, a ruptured appendix can cause peritonitis. If untreated this can lead to an overwhelming infection and death. ","47":"The pleura are thin two-layered membranes that line the outer surface of the lungs and inside surface of the ribcage. Pleurisy or pleuritis is an inflammation of the pleura. This inflammation is caused by many different disorders including: viral and bacterial infections, autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus), cancer, kidney failure, pulmonary embolism, and trauma.","470":"A disorder that has similar symptoms to an allergic reaction, including fever, rash and arthritis. Unlike a typical allergic reaction, the symptoms do not appear until 7-10 days after exposure to a medication or an antiserum. The most common implicated medications include: cephalosporins, penicillins, and sulfa drugs. ","471":"Painful inflammation of a tendon. Tendons are the fibrous attachments of the muscles to the bones. The inflammation can result from: overuse or over stretching of the tendon, trauma, infection, or inflammatory diseases. The sheath of the tendon can also become inflamed causing tenosynovitis. Common areas for tendonitis include the shoulder, elbow, knee, ankle, wrist, and hand.","472":"A hematoma (collection of blood) that pools on the septum of the nose after trauma. If left untreated it can cause a loss of fresh blood supply to the septum and destruction of the septum.","473":"A loss of normal brain function, such as memory, language, abstract thinking and analysis. It can occur from many different types of diseases. The two main causes are Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. The disease is progressive. Certain medications and alcohol can worsen the symptoms. ","474":"An infection caused by the Brucella bacteria. Patients become infected by coming in contact with the meat or ingesting the milk\/cheese of infected animals. The most commonly infected animals include cattle, goats, pigs, dogs, and camels. The disease is very rare in the United States. The bacteria may infect the bones (osteomyelitis), the brain (encephalitis), the heart valves (endocarditis), or the covering of the brain (meningitis). ","475":"Finger amputation is a partial or total removal of a finger.  Amputation may occur as a result of trauma or as treatment for a severe infection, frostbite or poor blood circulation. When trauma is the cause, replantation (reattachment) is the initial goal.","476":"An infection in a bone. Bone infections tend to occur in the spine (vertebra), in the foot or heel, or next to an artificial joint if the joint becomes infected. Osteomyelitis of the spine usually occurs after another serious infection has spread to the blood, bringing bacteria into the bone. Osteomyelitis of the foot or heel usually occurs with spread of infection from a foot ulcer (open skin sore). ","477":"The mitral valve separates the upper and lower chambers on the left side of the heart (left atrium and left ventricle). When the valve opens, blood flows from the left atrium to the left ventricle. When it closes, it prevents blood from flowing backward. In mitral stenosis the opening becomes narrowed restricting the blood flow. The main cause of mitral stenosis is rheumatic fever as a child. Other causes include congenital heart defects and a tumor on the valve that can block the blood flow. Severe stenosis can cause: heart failure, enlargement of the heart and atrial fibrillation.","478":"There are many different types of seizures. The most common is called a generalized seizure. It has also been called a tonic-clonic or grand mal seizure. Other types of seizures include petit mal seizures, partial (focal) seizures, febrile seizures and alcohol withdrawal seizures. A person may have a single seizure or repetitive seizures. People with recurrent seizures or at risk for recurrent seizures have epilepsy. A seizure results from an abnormal electrical discharge in the brain. Seizures can occur for many reasons, such as a head injury, an infection, a metabolic problem (for example, low blood sugar), a tumor, or drug use. Often the exact reason for seizures is not found.","479":"A pregnancy \u201ctumor,\u201d or epoulis, is a harmless growth in the mouth that develops in a small percentage of pregnant women. Pregnancy tumors appear during the second or third trimester. They are caused by the combined effects of poor oral hygiene and hormonal changes. Irritation of the area or trauma can make symptoms worse.","48":"Low back pain is pain in the lower (lumbar) area of the spine. Over 80% of people develop acute low back pain during their lives. The pain is defined as chronic if the symptoms last longer than three months. Most often the exact cause of low back pain is not identified. Doctors get concerned about a serious cause of low back pain when a person also has a history of cancer, osteoporosis or has other symptoms such as fever, night sweats, weight loss, weakness in the legs, loss of bladder or bowel control.","480":"Ganglion cysts are the most common benign soft tissue tumors of the hand and wrist, but can also occur in other areas of the body as well. The cause of these cysts is not known. One theory suggests that connective tissue degenerates over time due to irritation. The degeneration produces a hard outer coating and a mucin filled center. Ganglion cysts are three times more common in women and more common in young adults.","481":"Most antidepressants are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Common trade names for these medications include Prozac, Lexapro, Cymbalta, Zoloft, and Paxil. They can cause significant symptoms (serotonin syndrome) when taken as an overdose but are rarely lethal. Another class of antidepressants called tricyclic antidepressants can cause very serious and life threatening overdoses. The common tricyclic antidepressants include amitriptyline, amoxapine, desipramine, doxepin, imipramine, and nortriptyline. ","482":"The brain communicates with the spinal cord. The spinal cord transmits signals to the body through the peripheral nerves. Damage can occur to these nerves. This results in numbness, weakness, and\/or pain. Causes include: diabetes, alcohol, vitamin B12 deficiency, hypothyroid, lead poisoning, kidney failure, chemotherapy. Sometimes a cause of peripheral neuropathy is not found.","483":"\n  \t  A history and physical exam will be done. Moles with the ABCDE (see Description) traits of a melanoma should be biopsied to rule out the skin cancer called malignant melanoma. ","484":"A common skin condition that causes skin redness and irritation. The symptoms can vary widely from a mild irritation to a disabling disease. Psoriasis causes thick, red skin with flaky, silver-white patches called scales. The cause of the disorder is an over active immune system that attacks normal skin. Certain triggers can make the symptoms worse such as infections, skin injury, stress, cold weather, smoking, alcohol use, and certain medications. The disease tends to run in families. Some patients also have arthritis associated with the disease.","485":"An inflammatory disease of the lungs characterized by reversible airway obstruction. The tubes that carry air in the lungs are called bronchi and bronchioles. In asthma these tubes become narrowed because of abnormal muscular contraction of the tubes and from inflammation. The mucous lining of these tubes become irritated and secretes mucous and white blood cells into the airways, making the narrowing worse. In some patients this narrowing occurs in response to an irritant such as cold air, dust, pollen, exercise, or tobacco smoke. An upper respiratory viral infection (\"cold\" or URI) can also cause an asthma attack. The severity of symptoms varies greatly among patients, ranging from a mild irritant to life threatening collapse.","486":"Hand swelling can result from conditions such as inflammation, infection, allergic reaction, or cancer. Inflammation can be caused by trauma, arthritis, or an autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.","487":"A type of drug abuse characterized by the improper use of prescription drugs. The most commonly abused drugs are sedatives, stimulants and pain medications. It is estimated that up to 15% of high school seniors have illicitly taken prescription drugs.  The most commonly abused drugs are oxycodone LA (OxyContin), oxycodone (Percocet) and hydrocodone (Vicodin).                                                              ","488":"A disease in which a person's immune system attacks (autoimmune disease) the skin and mucous membranes (mouth and genitals). The outer part of the skin separates from the inner part of the skin in various places, causing blisters to form. These blisters can cause open sores and lead to skin infections. Rarely these infections can become serious. The disorder can occur at any age but is more common in the middle age group. There are three types of pemphigus. Pemphigus vulgaris is the most common type and affects the skin and mucous membranes. Pemphigus foliaceus only involves the skin. Paraneoplastic pemphigus involves the skin, and is associated with cancer.","489":"A disorder that results in chronic blockage of the airways of the lungs. The two most common types of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are emphysema and chronic bronchitis. The primary cause is smoking although not all patients who smoke get COPD. The extent of disease and symptoms experienced can vary widely. ","49":"The pulp is part of the tooth that contains blood vessels, supporting tissue and nerves. Healthy pulp is essential to keeping the tooth alive. Pulpitis occurs when there is inflammation of the pulp. It is mainly caused by bacteria entering the pulp because of cavities or tooth trauma.                                             ","490":"A foreign substance in the nasal cavity. It occurs most often in children when they put an object in their nose. At times the foreign body becomes lodged deep in the nose and cannot easily be seen by parents. It may cause symptoms of a runny nose and recurrent infections that are thought to be a sinus infection (sinusitis). At times these objects can be difficult to remove and may require general anesthesia for sedation.","491":"Salmonella infections are very common, and may cause up to one-third of all the cases of diarrhea produced by contaminated food. The most commonly infected foods are: meats, chicken, milk, unpasteurized cheese, eggs and cocoa beans. The disease most commonly affects the gastrointestinal tract and resolves without treatment. Some strains of salmonella can cause the condition \"typhoid\" which causes bloodstream infection, abdominal pain, fever and a rash.","492":"The result of prolonged exposure to hot temperatures, dehydration, or a failure of the brain to regulate the body's temperature. People that work in the heat, especially with high humidity, and do not drink enough fluids can experience heat exhaustion. If they do not get out of the heat and get appropriate treatment heat exhaustion can progress to heat stroke. Heat stroke is a life threatening emergency and can lead to permanent brain and kidney damage. The conditions that increase the risk of this disorder are being very young or very old, obesity, other chronic health problems, not being used to working the heat, and drinking alcohol.","493":"An inflammatory disease that may develop after an infection with Group A Streptococcus bacterial infection (such as strep throat or scarlet fever). The disease can affect the heart, joints, skin, and brain. If untreated, the heart valves can be permanently damaged, leading to heart failure. It is thought to occur from an abnormal reaction by the immune system causing the body to attack its own organs. It is uncommon in the United States but still occurs in developing countries. The disease is most commonly seen in 5-15 year olds but can affect adults as well.","494":"Lymph nodes drain lymph material from the surrounding area. They are located throughout the body. They may become enlarged for a number of reasons; the most common are a nearby infection, inflammation (lymphadenitis), or from cancer. The most common cause of enlarged lymph nodes in the groin is infection in the groin or genital area.","495":"Diabetic neuropathy is a type of peripheral neuropathy. It is a complication of diabetes that results in damage to the nerves in the body, caused by uncontrolled hyperglycemia (high blood sugar levels) for an extended period of time. It most often starts in the lower legs and feet. It may also affect the autonomic nerves (autonomic neuropathy), which may result in lightheadedness with standing, erectile dysfunction, incontinence, and difficulty emptying the stomach and bladder.

It may occur in both Type I and Type II diabetics. ","496":"Trauma to the kidney can be as simple as bruising that causes only temporary symptoms of bloody urine. It can also be more serious, causing kidney failure. Trauma is usually blunt injury (motor vehicle accident or fall) but can be a penetrating injury (gunshot wound or stab wound). Symptoms and treatment depend on the injury.","497":"Onycholysis is a condition where the nail separates from the nail bed.  The nail will appear white starting at the tip of the nail.  It is associated with trauma, working in wet environments, psoriasis, fungal nail infections (onychomycosis) or medications.   Multiple diseases are associated with this condition.","498":"Pneumonia caused by certain bacteria -- namely, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumonia, and Chlamydia pneumonia. The symptoms of these pneumonias tend to be less severe compared to other bacteria pneumonias. When not requiring hospitalization, they are often referred to as walking pneumonias.","499":"A change in brain chemistry causes a fidgety urge to move one's legs. This is a common cause of lost sleep. Symptoms are more severe at night or shortly after lying down. Older people, particularly women, are most likely to be affected. It is sometimes related to iron deficiency. It can run in families. It is common in pregnancy and in kidney disease.","5":"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is the growth of abnormal white blood cells in the bone marrow. The bone marrow is the soft spongy material contained in the center of the bones. There are several types of white blood cells normally produced by the bone marrow. These include neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes and monocytes. In this disease, the bone marrow makes more than the usual number of immature neutrophils and releases them into the blood stream. This over-growth of cells prevents the normal production of normal blood cells. Over ninety percent of cases come from a specific genetic mutation called the Philadelphia chromosome. The disease is most common in middle-aged individuals.","50":"The nasal septum separates the two sides of the nasal cavity. It is composed of cartilage and bone and is covered by mucous membrane. Many conditions can cause a hole (perforation) in the septum including trauma, drug abuse (cocaine), infections (tuberculosis, syphilis), nasal surgery, cancer, or nose picking.","500":"A temporary paralysis of a portion of the intestines after an abdominal surgery. The syndrome causes constipation, abdominal distension, and sometimes vomiting. It usually resolves on its own but may limit the ability to eat for some days following surgery. ","501":"Sudden sensation of unsteadiness or that the surroundings are moving. One feels as if spinning around on a merry-go-round or that the head is spinning. Benign positional vertigo (BPV) is one of the most common disorders that can cause vertigo. Symptoms increase with head movement and seem to get better when the eyes are closed and the head is still. BPV is common, especially in people over age 60. ","502":"A person who thinks she is pregnant when she is not. Despite not being pregnant the patient may experience many of the symptoms of pregnancy. The medical term is pseudocyesis. This disorder is rare and the cause is not known.","503":"Breathing is in excess of what is required for the metabolic demands of the body. Carbon dioxide levels drop and cause changes in the body's acid base status and calcium levels. Patients experience numbness around the mouth and in the hands and feet. Spasms of the hands and feet can occur. Causes include anxiety (as with panic attacks), pregnancy, and certain medications. Heart and lung disease and infections can also lead to hyperventilation.","504":"This virus can infect the lungs causing a rare, life threatening illness. Effective treatment is not yet available. Over35% of cases are fatal. Hantavirus is found worldwide and is spread by human contact with rodent waste. The most common animal involved is the deer mouse. This infection cannot be spread from human to human.","505":"Damage or death of heart muscle cells, caused by a blockage of an artery that supplies oxygen and nutrients to the heart (coronary artery). Symptoms can vary widely and can be atypical in the elderly, diabetics and women. The most common cause of the blockage is build- up of fatty deposits called plaque in the artery (atherosclerosis). High blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, family history of heart attacks and diabetes increase the risk of having a heart attack. If untreated, heart failure and death can occur, and at times very rapidly.","506":"Abdominal adhesions are bands of scar tissue that attach to the abdominal wall and abdominal organs. The most common cause of adhesions is previous abdominal surgeries. Adhesions can also be caused by an infection in the abdominal cavity (peritonitis) or endometriosis. Adhesions usually do not produce symptoms unless the intestines get kinked in the adhesions. If they do, a blockage or obstruction of the intestines can occur. If a bowel obstruction develops, this is a medical emergency and immediate attention should be sought.","507":"Tarantulas are a group of spiders with over 900 species. Some are big enough to kill mice or lizards but most are harmless to humans. Some are kept as exotic pets. The bites can be painful and a serious allergic reaction can occur if the person is allergic.","508":"An oral cleft is a gap in the lip, the palate, or both. Oral clefts occur when parts of the face and mouth don't fuse together as they develop during pregnancy. Oral clefts most often occur as a baby's only birth defect. However, they can also be linked to other problems. Clefts of the lip and palate occur in about 1 of every 800 babies born. For most oral clefts, there is no known cause.","509":"A serious impairment of blood-clotting mechanisms. Some process, usually an infection or cancer, causes the body to rapidly use the body's clotting factors and platelets. Small blood clots can clog arteries to important organs causing them to fail. In addition patients may experience excessive bleeding due to the decrease in clotting factors and platelets. ","51":"Can result from many different medications with antihistamines being the most common. Certain plants (jimson weed, red sage, and angel's trumpet) can also cause the syndrome. Drugs that can cause this disorder include scopolamine, benztropine, diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, doxylamine, hydroxyzine, diphenhydramine, and meclizine. This overdose can be intentional or accidental since many of these medications are commonly found in over the counter medications. ","510":"A disorder causing severe and persistent low mood. Other common symptoms include profound sadness, a sense of despair and a loss of pleasure for previously enjoyable activities. The diagnosis is made when mood changes and other symptoms of depression persist for at least 2 weeks. Major depression carries a risk of suicide if not appropriately treated. The cause of major depression is not known. An episode of depression can be triggered by a stressful life event, such as the death of a loved one. But in many cases, depression does not appear to be related to a specific event. Major depression may occur just once in a person's life or may return repeatedly.","511":"Phimosis is the inability to retract the foreskin over the head of the penis in an uncircumcised male. Phimosis can occur naturally in younger males but can also be caused by infection, poor hygiene or an injury to the hole in the foreskin that causes scarring. ","512":"A rare form of breast cancer that develops around the nipple. This medical condition is usually seen in patients greater than 50 years old.             ","513":"An inflammatory disease of the colon (large intestine) characterized by ulceration and episodes of bloody diarrhea. The inflammation begins in the rectum and spreads upward. The ulcerated areas become inflamed and may form small abscesses in the lining of the large intestine. The symptoms can be confused with an infection of the colon. The symptoms are recurrent. It is most commonly seen in women between the ages 15 and 40. There is an increased incidence of colon cancer associated with ulcerative colitis.","514":"The brachial plexus is a group of spinal nerves that run from the lower neck through the upper shoulder to the arm. Injury occurs when these nerves are stretched or torn during a traumatic injury. Sports, falls, and car accidents are the most common causes in adults. Infants can experience damage during childbirth. Injury causes pain, numbness, and weakness in the arm and shoulder. Many patients with this disorder will heal without specific treatment. ","515":"The common spider bite produces a local reaction. The bite results in redness, swelling and pain. Rarely, the bite can become infected with bacteria causing an abscess (collection of pus) or cellulitis (skin infection).","516":"A narrowing in the diameter of the renal arteries. The decreased blood flow to the kidneys may lead to high blood pressure (hypertension). The main cause of the narrowing is atherosclerosis (cholesterol deposits). Other more rare causes include fibromuscular dysplasia (a variation of blood vessel shape), inflammation of the arteries (vasculitis) and dissection of the artery (a tearing of the vessel).","517":"The rectum is the last part of the large intestine attaching to the anus. An abscess is a collection of pus. A rectal abscess also called \"perirectal\" abscess can form around the edge of the anal opening or deeper into the rectum. This condition is more often found in men and in people with digestive diseases.","518":"Cocaine is a commonly abused drug because of its euphoric effects and addictive properties. The drug stimulates the brain and heart and if too much is used serious side effects can occur such as an irregular heart rate (arrhythmia), stroke, seizure and death. Drinking alcohol while taking cocaine can increase the chance of death. There are multiple forms of cocaine and it can be injected into a vein, inhaled through the nose or smoked. ","519":"Infection of the middle ear (infection behind the ear drum). This infection causes infected fluid (pus) to collect in the middle ear. The middle ear contains the small bones of the ear. Otitis media is the most common cause of earaches. It is usually caused by bacteria, but it can start after a virus or allergy causes the ears and sinuses to be congested. Most infections heal on their own without antibiotics, as long as the infected fluid finds a path by which it can drain. In most cases, the middle ear drains through the eustachian tube, to the back of the nose. Occasionally, an ear infection drains through a hole that forms in the ear drum (perforated or ruptured ear drum).","52":"The sudden, unexplained death of a seemingly healthy infant younger than one year old. Most Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) deaths occur when babies are between two months and four months old. SIDS remains the leading cause of death for infants in the first year of life. The exact cause of SIDS is not known but the following recommendations can reduce the risk: place the baby on its back to sleep, do not smoke during pregnancy, offer a pacifier at sleep time, consider breast feeding, use a firm crib mattress, do not surround the baby with pillows, have the baby sleep in a crib, keep the baby's crib nearby and keep the baby's room at a comfortable temperature.\r\n\r\n","520":"Compression of the spinal cord in the neck. The most common causes are degenerative arthritis, thickening of ligaments, and herniated discs. The disorder is more common in the elderly, and patients experience neck pain, weakness, and numbness.","521":"Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) overdose causes an anticholinergic syndrome. Overdoses can result from deliberate or accidental ingestions. Patients become confused, have rapid heart rates, blurry vision, dry skin and can have seizures. Diphenhydramine is found in many over-the-counter medications and is most commonly used for allergic reactions, nasal congestion, and as a sleep aid.\r\n\r\n","522":"An inflammation or infection of the breast. It occurs in about 1% of new mothers and is more common in women who are breast-feeding. The most common bacterial cause is Staphylococcus aureus. It is believed the bacteria get into the breast through cracks in the skin. This disorder is more likely to occur if the breast feeding mother has skin irritation in the area of the nipple. In some cases mastitis can lead to the development of a breast abscess (fluid collection of infectious material).","523":"Infections from bacteria or amoeba may form a collection of infected fluid in the liver (abscess). The body tries to wall off this infected material causing the abscess to form. The bacterial infections lead to rapid generalized symptoms while symptoms related to an amebic abscess may develop more slowly. ","524":"The knee cap usually slips sideways to the outside of the knee. Dislocated knee caps most often occur in women. It is usually a result of sudden direction changes while running. It may also occur as a direct result of injury. ","525":"A foot ulcer is an open sore on the foot. The ulcer is often caused by either poor circulation or pressure or a combination of both. Foot ulcers are more common in certain conditions such as diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, atherosclerosis (hardening and narrowing of the arteries) and bony abnormalities like claw feet.  ","526":"The retropharyngeal space is behind the throat and in front of the spine. This space can become infected and develop a collection of pus, an abscess. The infection can close off the airway and result in death if untreated. The area becomes infected either by direct spread of an infection from the overlying throat or from the space being injured secondary to trauma.","527":"Benign lumps that are most commonly found in women in their late teens and early 20s. They also can be seen in older women on hormone therapy. They are the most common benign masses of the breast. ","528":"Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that affects humans and animals. It is caused by bacteria called Leptospira, which are found in water that has been contaminated by animal urine. The disease is more common in warmer climates. In humans it causes a wide range of symptoms, and some infected persons may have no symptoms at all. If the disease is not treated, the patient may develop kidney damage, meningitis (inflammation of the membrane around the brain and spinal cord), liver failure, and respiratory distress. The condition can be fatal.","529":"Hepatitis C is a viral infection that damages the liver. The virus is usually spread through contact with infected blood. Most infections occur due to sharing of injection drug equipment (needles) and can also occur by having sexual contact with an infected person. Hepatitis C can also be transmitted from infected mother to child during pregnancy or birth.  Most people have a brief period of very minor symptoms and don\u2019t realize that they were infected. Later they may develop chronic (long term) inflammation of the liver. Individuals at most risk are those workers exposed to blood (healthcare workers) and individuals who practice unprotected sex or share needles.  ","53":"A rupture of the Achilles tendon that extends from the lower calf to the heel. The injury most often occurs playing sports while running or jumping. Many people feel or hear a pop in the back of their ankle.\r\n","530":"A stab wound. These wounds can damage structures deep to the skin such as blood vessels, nerves, tendons, or any other important structures depending on the area injured. The object that caused the wound can carry bacteria or foreign material deep into the wound and cause infections. Puncture wounds from animal or human bites are especially prone to infections. ","531":"An accumulation of blood in front of the colored portion of the eye usually resulting from trauma to the eye. The hyphema may obstruct the flow of aqueous humor and lead to increased pressure within the eye (glaucoma). The increased pressure can cause permanent damage.","532":"The blood vessels that supply the heart are called the coronary arteries. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the narrowing of these arteries by fat and calcium build up called plaques. This is also called coronary atherosclerosis. The following characteristics lead to an increased chance of having CAD: smoking, obesity, family history of CAD, high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, diabetes, sedentary lifestyle, and kidney disease. Sometimes a plaque of atherosclerosis can suddenly rupture. That can cause a blood clot to develop and suddenly block the blood supply to the part of the heart that gets blood from the blocked artery. If that part of the heart muscle dies for lack of blood, it is called a heart attack. Symptoms of coronary artery disease can vary widely and in some patients like the elderly, diabetics and women there is no chest pain.","533":"Infection located somewhere in the outermost lining of the brain and spinal cord. The dura is the outermost lining of the brain and spinal cord. Infections may develop on the outside of this layer of tissue. The infection can get to the area either directly such as after trauma or through the blood stream. These infections are serious and can result in paralysis and\/or brain damage.","534":"A discoloration of the skin or a change in the surface or texture of the skin. Rashes typically result from irritation to the skin and common causes include: allergic reactions, infections, reactions to medications, reactions to chemicals (poison ivy), insect bites (bee stings), snake bites, or diseases of the skin (eczema, psoriasis etc.). Rashes can have many associated symptoms such as pain, itching, fever, and swelling. These other symptoms along with the appearance of the rash and how it started is how a healthcare provider determines the cause.\r\n","535":"Abdominal pain that occurs at the time of ovulation. The pain results from irritation of the abdominal cavity secondary to bleeding from the ovulation site. About 20% of women experience Mittelschmerz. The presence of the symptoms does not signify any structural disease.","536":"Usually occurs after blunt trauma. The majority are easily repaired. Fractures of the skull and injuries to the brain can occur. Further workup depends on the mechanism of injury and the symptoms experienced. If confusion, weakness, loss of consciousness, or vomiting occurs with the injury, immediate medical attention in an emergency department should be obtained.","537":"Neuroblastoma is the growth of abnormal cells in a specific part of the nervous system called the sympathetic nervous system. It affects infants and children and rarely occurs after age 10. Neuroblastomas develop most commonly in the spine and adrenal glands. However, they can also develop in the chest, neck and pelvis. ","538":"A stab wound to the scalp. These wounds can damage structures deep to the skin such as the skull, or brain. The object that caused the wound can carry bacteria or foreign material deep into the wound and cause infections. Puncture wounds from animal or human bites are especially prone to infections. ","539":"Thick, hardened, dead skin, that forms to protect the skin and structures under the skin from pressure, friction, and\/or injury. They are bumps that are yellow to gray in color. Calluses and corns become a problem when they grow large enough to cause pain or pressure in a shoe.","54":"Swallowing, injecting, breathing in, or otherwise being exposed to a harmful substance. Most poisonings occur by accident, but others are intentional. The symptoms can vary widely ranging from nausea and vomiting to seizures and death.","540":"Severe mouth pain that occurs 2 days or more after a tooth extraction. Dry socket is also called alveolar osteitis. The syndrome occurs because of the loss of the blood clot in the extracted tooth socket, which leaves the bone exposed to air, food or fluid. Dry socket is most common in smokers and after traumatic extractions such as impacted wisdom teeth. Carefully following the dentist's post tooth removal instructions can help prevent this complication.","541":"A cancer growth in the ovary. Symptoms including abdominal bloating or pain can be wrongly blamed on indigestion or other gastrointestinal problems, and this can delay diagnosis of this cancer. Delay of tests and quick growth of the cancer both make it common for ovarian cancer to be advanced when first diagnosed. It is most common after age 50, but can occur at any age. There are several different types of ovarian cancer. ","542":"A condition in which one vertebra becomes offset in its position over another. The main cause is degeneration of the discs in the spine. Other causes include congenital anomalies, trauma, tumors and bone diseases, and surgical procedures. Although this disorder most commonly occurs in the low back, it can occur in any part of the spine.","543":"The pericardium is a sac that surrounds the heart. Normally, there is a trace amount of fluid in this sac. Pericarditis is inflammation of the sac and it can result in accumulation of additional fluid around the heart (pericardial effusion). The most common cause is a virus. Pericarditis can also occur after cardiac surgery or heart attack (this is called Dressler's syndrome). Other causes are autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, scleroderma), cancer, kidney failure, and certain medications such as  procainamide and hydralazine). Rapid accumulation of a large pericardial effusion can be life threatening.","544":"The nasopharynx is the passage which connects the nose with the throat. Cancer can be slow or fast growing. Rapidly growing cancers can destroy surrounding normal tissue, and spread to other areas of the body (metastasize). People from Asia and Northern Africa have a higher risk of nasopharyngeal cancer. Smoking, excessive alcohol use, inhaling certain dusts and toxins may increase the risk of this type of cancer. The cancer is difficult to detect and is often large when discovered.","545":"Any break in a bone is called a fracture. The severity of the break is determined by its size and if alignment of the bones remains intact. If the alignment is not normal then the fracture is called displaced. The fractured bone fragments can be sharp and cause damage to surrounding nerves, tendons, surrounding organs and even puncture through the skin. Breaks that pierce through the skin are called open fractures. Open fractures are especially serious because they can become infected. A stress fracture is also called a hairline fracture and can sometimes be difficult to see on a plain x-ray. Sometimes a CT scan or MRI is needed to make the diagnosis. ","546":"A particular type of stroke that is caused by decreased blood flow in the vertebral or posterior inferior cerebellar artery of the brain. The affected areas of the brain are the brainstem and\/or the cerebellum. Patients most often experience problems with balance and speaking.                                                              ","547":"Occurs when the arm bone (humerus) is no longer in the shoulder joint. It most often occurs after trauma to the shoulder. In patients with multiple dislocations simply raising the arm over the head can cause the dislocation. Patients with multiple dislocations may have an MRI performed to identify associated ligament injuries.","548":"Muscle or nerve pain caused by repetitive use of a muscle or by clenching (tight contraction) of a muscle. Examples of overuse syndromes include: carpal tunnel syndrome, tarsal tunnel syndrome, tennis elbow, tendonitis, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome and certain sprains and strains. Also called cumulative trauma disorder or repetitive strain injury. ","549":"A cancer of the lymphocytes and the lymphatic system. There are two main types: Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's. Non-Hodgkin's is 5 times more common. The disease occurs when the lymphocytes of the immune system grow out of control becoming cancerous. The overgrowth of the lymphocytes typically causes swelling of lymph nodes. The cancerous lymphocytes can spread to other parts of the body (metastasize).","55":"A torus (plural \"tori\") is a harmless growth of bone in the mouth. Tori are usually found on the roof of the mouth, inside the lower jaw, or on the cheek side of upper molars. Tori are slow growing and vary in size. They usually do not interfere with eating or speech and are not cancerous.","550":"A condition where the patient (usually a teenager or young adult) has features of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Most children and teens with diabetes have Type 1 diabetes. In Type 1, there usually are antibodies against the cells in the pancreas that make insulin, and there is no insensitivity to insulin.  In Type 2 diabetes, the opposite is the case.  In double diabetes, patients have both antibodies against the beta cells and resistance to insulin. Overweight patients with Type 1 diabetes are at greatest risk of developing this disorder. The disorder generally develops gradually and first manifests itself as an increasing need for more insulin to control the glucose level. It is estimated that 15-20% of teens with Type 2 diabetes actually have double diabetes. In patients with Type 1 diabetes maintaining a healthy weight is the best way to avoid developing this disorder.","551":"Entamoeba histolytica is an ameba causing an infection of the intestines. In a severe case, infection may spread and cause an abscess elsewhere in the body, usually the  liver. This infection is more common in patients living in or traveling through tropical areas. The ameba is usually acquired by eating food or drinking water contaminated with the ameba. ","552":"Characterized by chronic, widespread pain and tenderness in multiple areas of the body. It can be associated with impaired sleep, fatigue and poor concentration. The disorder is common among women between the ages of 20 and 50. ","553":"Too much thyroid hormone. The thyroid gland is located at the base of the neck and produces thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone is an integral controller of the body's metabolism. Hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone) occurs when the thyroid gland produces and\/or releases an excessive amount of thyroid hormone, or too much thyroid hormone medication is ingested.","554":"Conversion disorder occurs when someone complains of the sudden onset of a symptom (blindness, deafness, paralysis, difficulty speaking, seizures) and there is no apparent medical cause. The symptom is produced unconsciously, often in response to a recent psychologic stress (death in the family, new job, birth of a child, etc.). Patients may describe their symptoms with a surprising amount of indifference. It is much more common in women than men and occurs most commonly between adolescence and middle age. A high percentage of people with conversion disorder have another psychiatric disorder.","555":"Increased pressure within the eye. Acute closed angle glaucoma is less common than chronic open angle glaucoma. It is caused by a narrowing in the pathway where aqueous humor (the fluid in the front part of the eye) exits. This fluid accumulates and causes increased pressure which can cause eye pain, nausea, headache, and visual loss.","556":"A sudden failure of the kidneys to function. Kidneys are essential to maintain the fluid and chemistry balance in the body. Kidney failure leads to a buildup of fluid and an increase in waste products in the blood stream. One serious side effect is an elevation in the blood potassium level (hyperkalemia) which can lead to life threatening heart arrhythmias and death. There are many causes of acute kidney failure. Causes  include infections, use of dye for CT scans or heart studies, medication reactions, auto immune diseases, severe dehydration, blocked flow of urine.","557":"Small growths in the large intestine (colon). The growths stick out from the inner lining of the colon, and push into the empty space inside the colon. Colon polyps usually are harmless although some will turn into cancers. Whether cancerous or not, polyps can bleed. Polyps are more common in patients with the following characteristics: eat low fiber diets, family history of polyps, overweight, cigarette smoker, over 50 years old or family history of colon cancer. Some families have genetic conditions that cause multiple family members to have multiple polyps. One such condition is called familial adenomatous polyposis. The incidence of these polyps becoming cancerous is quite high and many doctors recommend removal of the colon to prevent cancer.","558":"Caused by a group of microorganisms that have characteristics of both bacteria and viruses. There are many different types and they can cause diseases endemic to the United States including Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, and a whole host of diseases that can be acquired while traveling abroad including: Boutonneuse fever (i.e., Kenya tick-bite fever, African tick typhus, Mediterranean spotted fever, Indian tick typhus, Marseilles fever), typhus, and Q fever.","559":"A fracture (break) of a bone of the neck (cervical spine). There are 7 cervical vertebrae and a fracture in this area can result in paralysis of the arms and legs (quadriplegia), an inability to breath and death.","56":"An elevated level of cholesterol in the blood increases the risk of having narrowed arteries. The blockage is caused by a buildup of plaque and fat deposits (atherosclerosis). The diseases caused by this narrowing are dependent on the arteries being blocked but include: heart attacks, strokes, and peripheral vascular disease. People with elevated cholesterol also are likely to suffer from high blood pressure and diabetes. There are two types of cholesterol that make up the total level of cholesterol, LDL and HDL. LDL is considered bad cholesterol and HDL is good cholesterol. The most important number is the LDL cholesterol level. The ideal level is based on the person\u2019s individual risk of heart disease and stroke. A person\u2019s cholesterol profile is determined in part by inheritance, and in part by the foods he or she eats. ","560":"A condition in which there are not enough red blood cells in the blood secondary to the premature destruction of red blood cells. A normal red blood cell lives 120 days. Various conditions can cause the red blood cells to live a shorter life. These conditions include problems within the cells (intrinsic) or from factors outside the cell (extrinsic). Intrinsic factors include enzyme deficiencies (G6PD deficiency), abnormal red blood cells (sickle cell anemia, thalassemia), or infections (malaria). Extrinsic factors include autoimmune causes, blood clots, infections, or from medication side effects. If the bone marrow cannot keep up with the destruction of the cells then anemia (low red blood cells) results.","561":"Trauma to the lips, tongue and the inside of the mouth is quite common. The soft flesh of the lips and their exposed location make them vulnerable to injury. The teeth themselves can do damage if a fall or blow causes them to bite down on the lips, cheek or tongue. Any cut inside the mouth usually bleeds heavily because of the rich supply of blood to the area.","562":"There are many different types of mosquitos. A bite from one particular mosquito, the anopheles mosquito, can cause malaria.  The anopheles mosquito acquires the parasite (Plasmodium) that causes malaria by biting an infected person. Once the mosquito carries the parasite it can now infect other people after biting them. Malaria is most commonly found in Central and South America, Africa, and Asia.","563":"Use of substances, such as street drugs, alcohol, or prescription drugs if these are not taken for the reason they were prescribed. People commonly engage in substance abuse for purposes of getting \"high\", having an adventure, or escaping reality. Substance abuse can quickly become a preoccupation or an addiction. In addiction, patients lose control and have a compulsion to continue using the substance despite clear adverse personal and social consequences. The toll on the individual and society is significant with loss of work, loss of family, and increased risk of incarceration.","564":"A blood pressure that is too low to support bodily functions. It is often defined as a systolic pressure reading (the top number) that is less than 90 mmHg. However, some healthy people have blood pressures in this range and higher pressures may be too low for people used to much higher pressures. If insufficient blood is delivered to the cells of the body there will not be enough oxygen and other nutrients and the organs will begin to fail. Low blood pressure has many causes including: severe infection, blood loss, traumatic injuries to the chest or abdomen, heart attack, severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), heart arrhythmia, heart failure, medications, overdoses, and severe spinal cord injury.","565":"Doxylamine is an antihistamine and causes an anti-cholinergic syndrome after an overdose. The overdose can be accidental or deliberate. Patients exhibit confusion, blurry vision, fast heart rates, and dry hot skin and seizures.","566":"An elevation of the pressure in the brain. This can come from expansion of the fluid around the brain (cerebrospinal fluid), from bleeding into the brain, or from a brain tumor or abscess. Causes of raised intracranial pressure include: aneurysm rupture, subarachnoid hemorrhage, brain tumor, encephalitis, hydrocephalus, hypertensive brain hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, meningitis, pseudotumor cerebri, head injury, subdural hematoma, and stroke.","567":"A disorder of the inner ear caused by irritation and swelling that results in dizziness, room spinning (vertigo), and nausea\/vomiting. The symptoms typically become worse with head movement, and lessen by keeping the eyes closed. Labyrinthitis can occur during or just after an ear infection, with an upper respiratory infection or after a head injury. Often, no cause is determined. The symptoms usually resolve within a few days.","568":"Occurs when an infection, usually bacterial, causes severe systemic (whole body) illness. Bacteria types that can cause sepsis typically produce chemical toxins. Sepsis causes the blood vessels to dilate (go into shock). Sepsis can worsen so that it results in severe damage to multiple organs. Unfortunately even with treatment the disorder is frequently fatal. Almost any infection can result in sepsis although the most common are pneumonia (lung infection), urinary tract infection (bladder infection), abdominal infections, and cellulitis (skin infection). Patients with weakened immune systems are at the greatest risk of this disorder. These patients include: diabetics, patients on chemotherapy, HIV patients, patients taken powerful medications for auto immune diseases, infants, elderly patients, and patients with chronic diseases.","569":"Amphetamine (Methamphetamine) is a powerful stimulant that can cause a euphoric feeling in some users and goes by the street names \"speed\", \"meth\" and \"chalk\". The drug is very addictive and abuse leads to memory loss, aggression, psychotic behavior, heart damage, malnutrition, and severe dental problems. Amphetamines can be taken by mouth, smoked, injected, or inhaled. The chronic user can suffer severe psychological and medical damage.","57":"A disease caused by parasitic worms. Although schistosomiasis is not found in the United States, 200 million people are infected worldwide, and after malaria, is the second most prevalent tropical disease in the world. This disorder is found throughout Africa, South America, Asia and the Caribbean. Infection occurs after direct contact with infected water. The immature worms enter the body by penetrating the skin and infecting the body. Also known as bilharzia","570":"A cancerous growth of cells in the liver.  Liver cancer can arise from liver cells (primary liver cancer) or by spreading from a distant cancer (metastasis). Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary liver cancer and it is most frequently develops in patients with liver damage from the liver infections, hepatitis B and hepatitis C. The liver is located in the right upper abdomen and is essential for clearing toxins from the blood and for breaking down nutrients and other chemicals in the blood. ","571":"A common vaginal infection from overgrowth of the bacterium Gardnerella vaginalis. This disorder is also called bacterial vaginosis (BV). Left untreated BV can potentially cause infection of the tubes and uterus (pelvic inflammatory disease \/ PID) and lead to fertility problems. ","572":"Also called migraine with brainstem aura, it\u2019s a rare type of migraine. It starts with a disturbance of blood flow in the basilar artery, which is located in the back of the brain (brainstem). The first symptoms are usually dizziness, visual changes and imbalance (the aura) followed by a headache. The condition is more common in children and women. The following triggers can cause these migraines in susceptible patients: alcohol, stress, sleep deprivation, intense exercise, female hormonal changes (menstruation), bright lights, caffeine, some foods and certain medications.","573":"Cancer is characterized by an abnormal growth and spread of cells. Cancer is not a single disease. It can affect virtually any organ or tissue in the body. Its aggressiveness is highly variable, ranging from aggressive and rapidly life-threatening to slow-growing with little impact on the health of the organ or tissue. ","574":"Infection of a wound. The most common causes are the bacteria Staphylococcus or Streptococcus. A foreign body in the wound such as gravel, wood or glass increases the likelihood of an infection. Cuts that are very dirty or with injury to the surrounding skin such as a crush injury become infected more frequently. ","575":"A common cause of a skin irritation called contact dermatitis or pruritic dermatitis results from contact with the urushiol resin that poison ivy contains. This results in a red, itchy rash consisting of small bumps, blisters or swelling. Similar reactions occur after contact with poison oak and poison sumac.","576":"A group of diseases characterized by degeneration of motor neurons. Afflicted patients experience progressive weakness of voluntary muscle activity including speaking, walking, breathing, and swallowing. The most common disorders include: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (sometimes called Lou Gehrig's disease), primary lateral sclerosis, progressive muscular atrophy, pseudobulbar palsy, and spinal muscular atrophy.","577":"Small collections of minerals that form in the bladder, the organ in the pelvis that stores urine. Bladder stones are also called bladder calculi. They are more likely to form if the bladder can\u2019t completely empty all the urine. This might happen because of an enlarged prostate, neurogenic bladder or a urinary tract infection.","578":"A narrowing of the spinal canal of the neck. The narrowing can cause compression of the spinal cord and nerves exiting the spine. The canal becomes narrowed by degeneration of the bones and ligaments, by a herniated disc, or from a tumor. It is more common in patients older than 60 but can occur at any age.","579":"A serious lung infection (pneumonia) caused by the bacteria, Legionella pneumophila. The bacteria may involve other parts of the body including the gastrointestinal tract, the kidneys and central nervous system. Without antibiotic treatment this infection can be fatal. The bacteria grow in moist, warm environments and have been associated with hot tubs, fountains, evaporative coolers, air conditioners, misting systems and swimming pools. ","58":"Influenza is a common, contagious viral respiratory infection. People start developing symptoms about 24 to 48 hours after the virus first enters their body. There are three main types of influenza (A, B, C). Type A is most able to change its structure from year to year, giving it the ability to produce widespread outbreaks. Because Type A so frequently changes its structure, a new type of vaccine is required each year to protect against the strains of the virus that are circulating that year. The disease is usually self-limited (resolves without treatment), but can be fatal in the very young, very old, or if there is a coexisting depression of the immune system. It sometimes can be difficult to tell the difference between a cold and the flu based on symptoms alone. In general the flu is worse than the common cold and symptoms such as fever (usually over 101F) and body aches are more severe with the flu. For more information: http:\/\/www.flu.gov","580":"An extremely contagious viral illness also known as rubeola. The infection is spread through sneezing and coughing. It causes fever, cough, conjunctivitis, and a rash. Immunization has greatly reduced the number of childhood cases. Symptoms usually begin 7-14 days after exposure. Measles can be deadly.","581":"An abnormal growth of cells in the lung. The cancer can arise primarily from lung cells or by traveling from a distant tumor (metastasis). It occurs in adults of both sexes, usually between ages 40 and 70. Lung cancer causes more deaths than any other form of cancer. The incidence is steady or falling in recent years in direct relation to the reduction in cigarette smoking. The cancer cells destroy lung tissue and damage the surrounding organs. There are two main types of primary lung cancer: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer.","582":"Refers to inflammation of the endometrium, the inner lining of the uterus. Infection is the usual cause of the inflammation and the organisms that cause endometritis most commonly include: Chlamydia, gonococcus, and tuberculosis. The disorder is associated with childbirth, abortion, surgery or IUD use.","583":"Vitamin B12 deficiency is a decreased amount of vitamin B12 in the body.  It is also known as pernicious anemia. Vitamin B12 is essential for the normal production of red blood cells and for the normal functioning of nerves. Dietary vitamin is found almost exclusively in animal products and yeast (brewer's yeast). People with this deficiency may have a decreased number of red blood cells (anemia). The two main reasons for vitamin B12 deficiency are inadequate intake or inability for the intestines to absorb it. Strict vegetarians are at risk of B12 deficiency. One reason for inadequate absorption is the lack of a protein called intrinsic factor. It\u2019s made by the lining of the stomach and helps with the absorption of vitamin B12. Reasons for loss of intrinsic factor include an auto-immune problem whereby antibodies destroy it or stomach surgery. Absorption can also be impaired even with normal amounts of intrinsic factor if there is disease or surgical removal of the lowest section of the small intestine, or overgrowth of certain bacteria that steal the vitamin B12. ","584":"A skin ulcer is an open sore. The tissue below is exposed to the outside. Skin ulcers can occur on any area of the body. They more commonly appear in areas where there is prolonged pressure (buttocks, feet). Ulcers are often shallow, but may also be deep exposing bone and tendon. Certain individuals are more prone to ulcer development. They include people who have long standing diabetes, have poor circulation or are confined to bed paralysis. Poor nutrition also increases risk of skin ulcers.","585":"There are a many different types of urinary tract malformations. The great majority are congenital, and are diagnosed when the patients is still young. Some occur after surgery or after instrumentation of the ureter.","586":"Drug overuse is the misuse of prescription medications. This disorder can happen intentionally or accidentally. ","587":"Preeclampsia (toxemia) is a condition of pregnancy marked by high blood pressure, protein in the urine, and swelling of the feet and hands. Women with eclampsia have the same signs and symptoms and in addition have one or more seizures. Preeclampsia and eclampsia is seen after the 20th week of pregnancy. The following increase the risk of having preeclampsia and eclampsia: teenage pregnancy, previous history of preeclampsia, obesity, carrying more than one baby (twins, triplets etc.), having high blood pressure, mother's age greater than 35, and being of African American descent. This condition is very serious requiring immediate treatment.","588":"A complex partial seizure is related to an abnormal discharge of electricity in the brain. Normally, electrical signals in the brain flow in regular controlled pathways. In a complex partial seizure, the normal electrical pathways are disrupted, resulting in an abnormal discharge of electricity in an area of the brain (temporal lobe). Complex partial seizures often begin with an aura. During the seizure, the person loses awareness and may demonstrate unusual behavior.  ","589":"Traumatic removal of the finger nail. The injury can have other associated injuries, such as a nail bed laceration that may need to be repaired surgically.","59":"Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver. Causes of liver inflammation includes: infection, toxic ingestion, alcohol, or an autoimmune disease. Infections are most often caused by viruses. There are many types of viral hepatitis but types A, B and C are the most common. Types B and C can cause chronic infection and result in cirrhosis and death.","590":"A heart rate below 60 beats a minute is called bradycardia. A heart normally beats between 60 and 100 times a minute at rest. Resting bradycardia can be normal in athletes. The most common reason for a slow heart is medication, especially beta blockers. Other causes include impaired electrical conduction in older people, heart attacks, inflammatory or infectious heart conditions and congenital defects.","591":"A throat infection. Acute inflammation and infection of the pharynx can be caused by bacteria or viruses. Approximately 40%-60% of cases of pharyngitis are caused by a virus and about 15% are caused by the Streptococcus bacteria (strep throat). Other bacteria that can cause this infection include: Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Most infections that cause pharyngitis are contagious. Frequent hand washing and covering one's mouth when coughing can decrease the spread of the infection. ","592":"The adrenal gland does not make enough of the hormones cortisol and aldosterone. Cortisol is essential and helps maintain blood pressure, normal heart function, glucose metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, protein metabolism, fat metabolism, and normal emotional well-being. Aldosterone helps the body maintain normal blood pressure, water and salt levels. The adrenal gland is located on top of the kidneys in the abdomen. There are two types of Addison's disease (adrenal insufficiency), primary and secondary. In primary the adrenal gland is damaged usually from an autoimmune disease.  Other causes include infections, cancer and bleeding into the gland. Secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs when the pituitary gland in the brain does not produce enough adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH tells the adrenal gland to produce cortisol. In secondary adrenal insufficiency the adrenal gland itself is normal. The most common cause of secondary disease is taking corticosteroids. Any other problem that damages the pituitary gland such as cancer, infection or surgery can also cause the secondary form of the disease. If left untreated an Addisonian crisis can occur which can be life threatening. The most common causes of this crisis are physical stresses such as an infection, trauma, or surgery.","593":"Too much wax in the ear that blocks the ear canal. Earwax (cerumen) is part of the body's natural defenses and it protects the ear canal by trapping dirt and slowing the growth of bacteria. When too much wax forms pain and other symptoms can occur.","594":"An aneurysm is an abnormal dilation of an artery. The femoral artery is located in the groin. Femoral artery aneurysms are rare and are most often found in older patients and are more commonly associated with the following conditions: smoking, diabetes, and\/or hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis). They may develop after cardiac catheterization.  Most patients do not have any symptoms and the aneurysm is found during a healthcare provider\u2019s physical examination.","595":"A type of brain tumor (glioma) that consists of an abnormal growth of astrocytes, a normal cell type within the brain. It can be benign or malignant. Even slower growing benign tumors can be life threatening by compressing the brain causing damage, leading to increased pressure in the brain (raised intracranial pressure). Astrocytoma are graded I, II, III or IV. Grade IV is highly aggressive and malignant and termed a glioblastoma multiforme.","596":"The mitral valve separates the upper and lower chambers on the left side of the heart (left atrium and left ventricle). The valve opens allowing blood to flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle and then closes preventing blood from flowing backward. The mitral valve consists of two leaflets and prolapse occurs when these leaflets do not close properly and may allow some blood to backflow. It is more common in young to middle age women. Most people do not experience any symptoms. With severe prolapse, backflow of blood (mitral regurgitation) may cause symptoms.\r\n","597":"An enlargement of the thyroid gland. This gland is located in the neck and produces a lump in the middle of the neck near the \"Adam's apple\". This disorder occurs much more frequently in women than in men. The most common causes of a goiter are: iodine deficiency (especially in the developing world), autoimmune diseases (such as Graves' Disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis) and multiple thyroid nodules (multinodular goiter). If thyroid hormone levels in the blood are normal, people with a goiter usually have no other symptoms. However, if the thyroid becomes too large it can push on the wind pipe and cause breathing problems.","598":"A jaw fracture is a crack or break of the jaw bone (mandible). Jaw fractures are the third most common facial fracture. They are usually the result of trauma such as a motor vehicle accident, assault or sports injury.","599":"Severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy and most often occurring during the first trimester. It can cause dehydration and drastic changes in body chemistry, and may be dangerous to the mother and baby. The exact cause is unknown but risk factors include: first pregnancy, hyper-emesis gravidarum during a previous pregnancy, having a multiple pregnancy (such as twins or triplets), and being overweight, The disorder occurs in about 0.5 to 2% of all pregnancies.","6":"Ophthalmoplegia is weakness of one or more of the muscles that position the eyes. This results in double vision. It can be present at birth, although some people born with this can compensate during childhood and don't notice bothersome symptoms until they are adults. Some other causes include: myasthenia gravis, thyroid disease, multiple sclerosis, migraine headache, supranuclear palsy, Wernicke's encephalopathy, stroke, brain tumor, and cavernous venous thrombosis. This condition is not the same as \"strabismus,\" which is a wandering eye that occurs in children.","60":"An infection caused by the bacteria Francisella tularensis. The infection is acquired by contact with infected tissue of rodents or through the bite of an infected tick, horse fly or mosquito. The disease is most commonly found in North America, Europe and Asia. Fatal cases can occur in up to 5% of untreated patients and 1% of those receiving the appropriate antibiotic. The infection can involve bone (osteomyelitis), the heart (pericarditis), the brain (meningitis), or the lungs (pneumonia). ","600":"A form of child abuse. The caretaker (frequently the mother) produces factitious symptoms of disease about the child. This history generates multiple medical tests and surgical procedures on the child and can result in serious adverse effects and significant harm. It is rare and poorly understood. The cause is unknown. ","601":"Nearsightedness is the difficulty seeing distant objects. It can be an inherited disorder and is caused by an eye that is too long from front to back. The eye focuses the object in front of the retina which results in blurred vision. Nearsightedness is a very common visual problem. ","602":"A collection of infectious material that is present in the ovaries and\/or the fallopian tubes (the tubes that carry the egg from the ovaries to the uterus). The infection usually starts as a sexually transmitted infection of the cervix, then extends into the ovaries and tubes (pelvic inflammatory disease). As the infection progresses an abscess is formed. This infection is very serious and can lead to infertility.","603":"Inflammation of the vagina resulting from overgrowth of one of several bacteria normally present in the vagina. Normally the vagina contains more good bacteria than harmful bacteria. This disorder occurs when more harmful bacteria are present. The cause of bacterial vaginosis is unknown but the following conditions increase the chance of getting this disease: new sexual partner, multiple sexual partners, and douching. ","604":"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common gastrointestinal emergency in premature newborns.  It is a condition where there is varying damage to the intestinal tract leading to tissue death. It is potentially life threatening, but most infants survive. The exact cause is unknown.","605":"The meninges are the covering of the brain. Abnormal growth of these cells causes a tumor called a meningioma. These tumors are generally slow growing and do not spread beyond the brain. Symptoms depend on the size and location of the tumor. Some tumors are found incidentally when a CT scan is done for another reason. This disorder is more common in older adults and is very rare in children.","606":"Carpal tunnel syndrome is due to compression of the median nerve in the wrist. The median nerve supplies sensation to the palm side of the thumb, index, and middle fingers and the thumb-side of the 4th finger. This nerve also controls the movement of the thumb. The median nerve travels through a narrow space in the wrist called the carpal tunnel with the transverse carpal ligament forming the roof of the tunnel. Swelling in the tunnel causes compression of the median nerve within this tunnel resulting in the symptoms. Repetitive hand movements may increase the likelihood of developing this disorder. It is more common in women than men, is seen more commonly in people with rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes, and most often occurs after age 30.","607":"A foreign object in the eye is usually in the conjunctival sac under the upper or lower lids, or adhered to the cornea. If the foreign body travels deeper into the eye and enters the globe serious eye damage and loss of vision can result.","608":"An autoimmune disorder characterized by progressive fatigue and muscle weakness. Muscle strength may be normal at the beginning of a task such as talking; then it becomes progressively weaker as the activity continues. Antibodies block, alter, or destroy the receptors for acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, preventing normal muscle contraction. It is more common in young females. It is sometimes associated with a tumor of the thymus (thymoma).","609":"Birth control pills are a common type of contraception. There are many different types of pills but they all contain hormones that change the normal monthly female reproductive cycle by preventing the release of an egg from the ovary (ovulation). The most common types are combination pills that contain both estrogen and progesterone. There are three types of regimens. The first and most common contain the combination hormone medicine for 21 days and then either take a \"dummy\" pill for 7 days or no pill for 7 days. This regimen enables a woman to have a menstrual cycle every month. A second type involves taking the combination hormone pill for 12 weeks and then stopping for 7 days. This reduces the number of periods to every 12 weeks. A third form is called the \"mini pill\" and contains only low dose progesterone. This regimen may be less effective than the combination pill. Some of the side effects of birth control pills include irregular menstrual bleeding, mood changes and blood clots.","61":"An eye disease that damages the blood vessels of the retina and is a complication of diabetes. Other common eye diseases of diabetes are cataracts and glaucoma. The retina is the back of the eye that collects light and enables one to see. Retinopathy is any disorder affecting the retina. Diabetic retinopathy is the most common diabetic eye disease and is one of the most common causes of blindness. There are multiple forms of this disease. In one type small blood vessels in the eye swell and leak fluid, causing fluid build-up in the retina. In the other type, extra blood vessels grow (proliferative retinopathy) causing retinal bleeding and decreased blood flow to the retina. Both forms can cause a gradual or sudden loss of vision. Early detection and treatment can slow down the visual loss.","610":"Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) if not treated. The condition gradually destroys the immune system, preventing the body from fighting off infections. There is no permanent cure. However, with anti-viral drug treatment, the prognosis is excellent.","611":"Bacterial infection caused by Vibrio cholerae within the small intestine producing watery diarrhea. It usually occurs in epidemics. Most commonly the disease is associated with poor sanitation. Cholera is spread between humans from ingestion of contaminated food or water. The illness begins suddenly with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The symptoms can be severe leading to dehydration and death. ","612":"Cardiomyopathy is the general term for abnormal heart muscle. Most often it refers to a weakening of the heart muscle which reduces how forceful it can pump. It is often associated with congestive heart failure and arrhythmias. Cardiomyopathy may be caused by alcoholism, heart attacks, heart valve abnormalities, viral infections, high blood pressure, nutritional deficiencies, inflammatory diseases, and after delivering a baby. Cocaine abuse and certain chemotherapy drugs can also cause cardiomyopathy.","613":"A gradual weakening of the head of the femur. The femur is the long bone of the upper leg that connects the hip and the knee. The head or ball of the femur and the pelvis make up the hip joint. In this disorder the ball of the femur loses its blood supply causing the ball of the femur to die. It usually affects only one hip, but both hip joints can be involved. It occurs most frequently in children between the ages of 4 and 12. It is more common in boys. The cause of this disorder is not known.","614":"Intravenous (IV) drug abuse can result in many adverse effects including: psychosis, depression, infection, heart disease, loss of job, or death. Depending on the drug being abused, there can be significant withdrawal symptoms. Many patients with this disorder share needles and are at risk for HIV infection, hepatitis, and serious bacterial infections. ","615":"The third cranial nerve, also called the oculomotor nerve, is one of three cranial nerves that control the movement of the eye. This nerve also controls constriction of the pupil and eyelid movement. A complete third nerve palsy causes the eye to be stuck downward and outward, a droopy eyelid and dilated pupil. The actual symptoms experienced depend on where the damage to the nerve occurs as it travels from the brain to the eye and the extent of damage. In some cases, only the eye muscle weakness is experienced. Conditions causing this disorder include congenital oculomotor palsy, diabetes, atherosclerosis, cerebral artery aneurysms, brain tumors, meningitis, traumatic injuries, multiple sclerosis, thiamine deficiency (Wernicke encephalopathy) and cavernous sinus thrombosis.","616":"Warfarin inhibits vitamin K dependent coagulation factors. It is used to thin the blood and is prescribed in the following conditions: heart arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation), stroke, heart stents, deep vein thrombosis (blood clot), pulmonary embolus (blood clot of the lung), mechanical heart valves, and hyper-coagulable disorders. The patient's blood is checked periodically to monitor the effectiveness of the medication. Dietary changes and new medications can alter the effects of the drug causing either too much or too little anti-coagulation.","617":"Methanol is found in canned heating sources, antifreeze, windshield wiper fluid, fuel additives, and paint removers. Ingestion can be intentional or accidental. Methanol is converted into toxic metabolites that can cause blindness, confusion, and gastrointestinal symptoms. If left untreated it can be deadly.","618":"Listeria is a bacteria that causes the food borne illness listeriosis. Listeriosis causes fever, chills, headache, and vomiting, and can be fatal. The bacteria listeria is unique because it can live and grow in the cold temperatures of the refrigerator. Only heat can kill this germ. The bacteria cannot be tasted or smelled and patients can become sick 2-30 days after eating infected foods. Pregnant women, patients with a weak immune system, and the elderly are the most susceptible and they should be extra careful with certain foods. The best way to prevent an infection is to use precooked foods and ready to eat foods as soon as possible, avoid raw milk, only eat cheeses made from pasteurized milk, wash fresh fruits and vegetables, scrub the outside of melons before cutting, and avoid eating meat and seafood that are not well cooked. Remember the best way to be safe about a food is to make sure it fully cooked at high temperatures since this is the only method to kill the bacteria. The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) provides more information here: http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nczved\/divisions\/dfbmd\/diseases\/listeriosis\/.","619":"Infection of the bile ducts or the entire biliary tree. The bile ducts carry bile from the gallbladder to the small intestine. Cholangitis usually arises from a blockage of the bile duct from a gallstone. Once blocked, the bile duct then becomes infected. This disorder is very serious and can be fatal if not treated. ","62":"Eustachian tube dysfunction means that the hollow canal between the inner ear and the back of the throat is not functioning normally. The tube should remain open to maintain equal pressure between the back of the throat and the middle ear. If the canal closes, pressure can build up inside the middle ear causing discomfort and sometimes damage. For example, the canal can collapse during an airplane flight, while scuba diving or driving up a high mountain road. Upper respiratory tract infections, allergies and colds increase the chances of collapse. ","620":"An abnormal growth within the brain and skull. It can be benign or cancerous (malignant). Even a benign tumor can be life threatening in certain locations or if it causes compression and\/or elevation of the pressure in the brain (hydrocephalous). Malignant tumors can arise from cells of the brain, such as astrocytomas, or from cells transported to the brain through the blood stream or lymphatic system (metastases).","621":"A group of headaches that include migraine. It was believed the pain originated from dilation of the blood vessels of the head resulting in the headache experienced. It is an outdated term and some authorities reject the original premise that these headaches arise from abnormalities of the blood vessels.","622":"Kidney stones are small, solid particles that form in one or both kidneys. The majority of kidney stones contain calcium oxalate. Other types of stones contain uric acid, struvite, and cystine. They generally do not cause problems until they enter the tube connecting the kidney to the bladder (ureter) causing obstruction of the urine flow from the kidney to the bladder. The obstruction causes severe pain. The following conditions increase the risk of developing kidney stones: obesity, a family history of the disorder, diets high in protein, previous gastric bypass surgery, and dehydration.\r\n","623":"Cerebrospinal fluid that leaks out the nose. A basal skull fracture is the most common cause.","624":"Toxic synovitis and transient synovitis are different names for the same condition: an inflammation of synovium, tissue that lines the inside of many body joints. The condition is caused by a viral infection. Most often, the condition involves the hip. The disorder is more common in boys and most commonly affects children 3-10 years of age. Inflammation of the synovium of the hip causes the child to cry when crawling, to limp or refuse to walk.  The illness begins with a low grade fever. No specific treatment is needed. The healthcare provider may do tests to ensure the patient does not have septic arthritis, a serious bacterial infection of the joint.","625":"Painful cramps during the menstrual period. Primary dysmenorrhea usually begins within a year or two of the first period (menarche) and recurs with each period. Fertility is usually not affected. The severity of symptoms is variable. Dysmenorrhea symptoms usually lessen after childbirth and on birth control pills.","626":"A bacterial infection of the muscle. The most common bacterial cause is Staphylococcus.  Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) is becoming a more common cause. The disorder usually begins as an infection in the blood stream that spreads to the muscle. Traumatic injury of the muscle increases the likelihood of this disease. Three fourths of all patients have a weakened immune system either from disease such as HIV or from medications such as chemotherapy. Pyomyositis is most often seen in children aged 2-5 but this order can occur in any age group. The muscles of the pelvis and legs are most commonly affected. The disease is more commonly encountered in tropical regions. Left untreated the infection can involve other organs.","627":"The femur, or thigh bone, connects to the pelvis at the hip joint. Hip fractures are breaks in the upper part of the femur where it meets the pelvis. 0ver 200,000 hip fractures occur every year, with 50% of those in people age 80 or over. These fractures need to be repaired and carry a high mortality if left untreated. Most are related to osteoporosis and occur after a fall.","628":"Immobility can increase the risk of: constipation, blood clots, skin ulcers, muscle wasting and deconditioning.","629":"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a type of breast cancer that lacks the three most common hormone receptors: growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), estrogen receptors (ER), and progesterone receptors (PR). Most of the common breast cancer treatments target these receptors. Therefore, individuals with triple negative breast cancer do not have access to these therapies. However, chemotherapy works well for TNBC and may be given before or after surgery. TNBC represents 15-20% of all breast cancer in the US and is more common in women who are young, African-American and who have the BRCA1 gene. TNBC tends to grow quickly and has a worse outcome than other types of breast cancer.","63":"Degenerative disc disease is the progressive deterioration of one or more cushions between the bones of the spine. Over time, the disc between the bones of the spine hardens. There may no symptoms or it may result in pain, decreased movement and possible compression of the nerves as they leave the spinal cord. This disease is extremely common and symptoms are worsened by obesity and lack of exercise.","630":"A rare disorder that results from decreased production of the hormones of the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is a part of the brain that is located behind the nose and between the ears. The gland produces hormones that control almost every major function of the body. These hormones include growth hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin, ACTH, antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin. The main cause of panhypopituitarism is damage to the pituitary gland from trauma, cancer, infection, stroke, and severe blood loss during pregnancy.","631":"An abnormal response of the immune system of the body to some type of foreign substance. The substance that triggers the allergic reaction is called an allergen. Initial contact with the allergen does not produce any symptoms. However, with time the immune system begins to form antibodies to the allergen. Future interactions with the allergen trigger more dramatic responses. The response to these sensitizing allergens varies from sneezing to respiratory difficulty, shock, and death.","632":"Caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi. Deer ticks can carry the bacteria, and the disease is acquired after being bitten by an infected tick. Some patients don't remember the tick bite. There are three stages to the infection. See the symptoms section for a description. If untreated the disease can sometimes be serious involving the heart, brain, joints and nerves. The CDC states 94% of all Lyme disease cases occurred in the 12 states: Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin.","633":"Fleas are wingless insects that live on animals including humans. They feed on the blood by biting the animal and live in the fur or hair of the host. There are many different types of fleas but they all belong to the order Siphonaptera. Fleas are very small (1\/16th-1\/8th inch) and can jump from animals to humans. The most common way for a patient to be infected is by having a pet with fleas. Generally flea bites cause red itchy bumps. At times these bites can become infected with bacteria causing a skin infection called cellulitis. The bite of fleas can also carry diseases that are passed on to patients through the saliva of the flea during the bite. The most well-known disease is bubonic plague caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis. ","634":"Blood pressure too low to support vital functions. Shock can occur from the following conditions: bleeding, dehydration, heart failure, overwhelming infection (sepsis), severe trauma, severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), or spinal trauma.","635":"Melanoma is the most dangerous skin cancer. The cancer comes from an abnormal growth of cells that produce skin pigment (melanocytes). Exposure to the sun or tanning beds increases one's risk of the disorder. Early detection and treatment enables the cancer to be removed before it spreads (metastasizes). Once the tumor has spread to lymph nodes and other organs the cure rate decreases. Besides the skin these tumors can occur in the eyes and other organs. ","636":"Exposure to cold can cause a dangerously low body temperature (hypothermia). The very old, very young, those with chronic illnesses, and the intoxicated are most susceptible. Becoming wet causes a particularly rapid drop in body temperature. Death can result from cardiovascular collapse.","637":"A rectal foreign body is usually non-accidental and is generally placed by the patient. It can cause pain, bleeding, tenesmus (an urgent desire to defecate) intestinal erosions or perforation.","638":"A stab wound to the leg. These wounds can damage structures deep to the skin such as blood vessels, nerves, or tendons. The object that caused the wound can carry bacteria or foreign material deep into the wound and cause infections. Puncture wounds from animal or human bites are especially prone to infections. If bleeding occurs in a muscle compartment of the leg it can cause a limb threatening disorder called compartment syndrome.","639":"Refers to a group of more than 30 inherited diseases that cause muscle weakness and muscle loss. The muscles are unusually susceptible to damage. Symptoms first appear at various ages, from infancy to middle age, but all forms become worse with age and are progressive. The different muscular dystrophies vary in who they affect and the symptoms. ","64":"Fracture of the bones around the eye. Orbital fractures usually occur from head or facial trauma. There are four walls to the orbit and the most commonly fractured is the inferior (bottom) wall. Fractures can involve the sinus coverings and\/or base of the skull; fractures in these areas can result in dripping of cerebrospinal fluid from the nose. (This fluid looks like water.) The eye muscles can be trapped in an orbital fracture, causing double vision.","640":"Can be simple involving only the skin or complex with injury to tendons, nerves and\/or blood vessels. With tendon lacerations, there is weakness in the part of the extremity (ankle, foot or toe) normally moved by the tendon, and with nerve damage, numbness is experienced beyond the laceration.","641":"Recurrent constipation and\/or diarrhea associated with abdominal pain. The colon in irritable bowel syndrome is normal appearing, but the symptoms are thought to come from abnormal contractions of the colon. It is not contagious or inherited. Women are affected twice as often as men and the cause of the disorder is not known.","642":"Painful, brief muscle cramps. Heat cramps generally occur after exercise or work in a hot environment or begin a few hours later. The most common muscles involved are the thighs, shoulders and calves. Patients who are not used to working in hot weather and those who sweat a lot are at increased risk for this disorder. Drinking fluids without any salt intake may also increase the chance of getting heat cramps. Heat cramps generally resolve on their own without specific treatment.","643":"The uvea is the portion of the eye that contains the iris, the ciliary body and the choroid. Uveitis or iritis is inflammation of this area. It is most commonly seen between the ages 20 to 50. It can be serious, causing permanent loss of vision. Uveitis may occur without any identified cause, but it is often caused by autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis), inflammatory conditions (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), trauma, and infections (toxoplasmosis, syphilis, tuberculosis).","644":"Occurs when the nerve in the tooth becomes exposed through tooth decay or inflammation (pulpitis). Pulpitis refers to the inflammation of the dental pulp within the tooth caused by bacteria that enter the space through tooth decay. The pulp contains the blood vessels, the nerves and connective tissue inside a tooth.","645":"Swelling of the eyelid can result from trauma, inflammation, allergic reaction, infection, or from a stye. ","646":"Bleeding into the lower portion of the brain, the cerebellum. The cerebellum is located at the base of the skull and controls coordination, balance, and equilibrium. Bleeding into this area causes dizziness, loss of coordination, vomiting. The bleeding can result from a stroke, high blood pressure, brain tumor, arterial aneurysm, or cocaine.","647":"A foreign body is an object in the body that does not belong there. It often causes pain, inflammation or other symptoms requiring it to be removed. Examples include a small toy that lodges in a child's windpipe or a surgical instrument left in a wound after an operation.","648":"The result of a successful fertilization of an egg. The egg implants in the uterus and the fetus develops in the gestational sac. A corpus luteum cyst develops and produces HCG, the main hormone used to follow the pregnancy. ","649":"Fatigue, insomnia and other symptoms that occur with crossing time zones. This disorder occurs because of the disruption of a patient's circadian rhythm. The following conditions increase the risk of getting jet lag: drinking alcohol, caffeine use, becoming dehydrated on the trip, and flying across multiple times zones.","65":"Spider veins are the result of the dilation of small veins under the skin. Areas of purple and blue with a characteristic spider-like appearance can be seen through the skin of individuals affected with this problem. Spider veins occur most commonly on the thighs, ankles and calves. They are not dangerous.","650":"Methamphetamine is a central nervous system stimulant. It affects chemicals in the brain and nerves that contribute to hyperactivity and loss of impulse control. Methamphetamines are commonly abused, and can be manufactured in makeshift small laboratories. It is taken orally, intranasally, by needle injection, or by smoking. This drug is very addicting and long term use can cause weight loss, severe dental problems, violent behavior, paranoia, visual and auditory hallucinations, and delusions. ","651":"The most common form of dementia. Dementia is a brain disorder that affects memory, thinking and behavior. In its more severe stages, the disease prevents people from performing their daily activities, recognizing their family and friends, and from understanding speech or speaking. It is a devastating disease that becomes worse with time and can progress rapidly in some individuals. Early identification enables families to prepare for the progression of the symptoms and arrange appropriate supportive services. The disorder is more common in older patients although it is not part of normal aging. The likelihood of acquiring the disorder is also increased with a family history of Alzheimer's, long standing hypertension and previous head trauma.","652":"Abnormal joint fluid accumulation due to inflammation, but not caused by a bacterial infection. The exact cause is not always determined but possible causes include viral infections and arthritic disorders.","653":"A hernia of the bladder, usually into the vagina and introitus. It may occur from excessive straining or stretching of nearby tissues, such as during childbirth, chronic constipation or heavy lifting. It is more common in older women and those who've given birth to several children.","654":"Fainting while coughing or just after a coughing spell. The fainting is usually associated with severe and prolonged episodes of coughing. This disorder is much more common in adult men. Coughing stimulates autonomic nervous system reflexes. These reflexes connect the brain, heart and respiratory system. When they are stimulated, it causes blood pressure to temporarily drop, and heart rate to temporarily slow down. As a result, the brain briefly does not get enough blood, leading to fainting. Smoking increases the likelihood of this problem.","655":"Hyperkeratosis is the thickening of the outer layer of skin. There are many causes of thick skin and these include viral infections (warts), inflammation over a long period of time (callus and corn), sun exposure (actinic keratoses), irritating chemicals and inherited disorders. ","656":"Conduct disorder refers to a set of behavioral and emotional problems in children and adolescents. These problems may include drug abuse, criminal activity, oppositional behavior and defiant behavior. The disorder is more common in boys and is linked to poverty, family conflicts and parental drug\/alcohol abuse.","657":"Turner syndrome is a condition that only affects female children and results from a missing or incomplete sex chromosome. Infertility and short stature are common. Some individuals have extra skin on their neck (webbed neck), heart defects, bone or kidney problems. The majority of patients with Turner syndrome have normal intelligence but some experience developmental delay, learning or behavioral problems. Most cases of Turner syndrome are not inherited and occur as the result of a random event during development.","658":"A rapid heartbeat that starts in the ventricles. The disorder is very dangerous because the heart is beating so fast and working so hard that sometimes it cannot get the blood supply it needs. VT can also turn into ventricular fibrillation (VF), a potentially fatal irregular heart rhythm. In VF the heart is no longer beating: it just quivers, and no longer pumps blood to the body (cardiac arrest). Unless corrected immediately, VF results in death. VT occurs because of abnormal electrical communications within the heart. The most common causes are a heart attack, heart failure, illicit drug use, congenital heart defects, previous heart surgery, trauma to the heart, and chemical abnormalities in the blood (electrolytes).","659":"A traumatic spine injury that results in greater weakness in the arms than the legs. It is most common with a forced hyperextension of the neck. The disorder is most commonly seen in older adults, especially those with pre-existing degenerative disc disease and arthritis of the cervical spine in the neck. But it can occur at any age.","66":"Scalp swelling can result from trauma, infection, inflammation, abscess, allergic reaction, or tumor. Inflammation can occur from a medication reaction, trauma or an autoimmune disease.","660":"Amalgam tattoos are tiny metal particles from amalgam fillings or metal false teeth (crowns or caps) that become embedded in the gums, cheek, lips, tongue or roof of the mouth. They appear as dark spots in your mouth that are usually flat and very small. They are common, not dangerous, and can be created during many dental procedures. A small percentage of dark areas are not amalgam tattoos, but are precancerous, non-cancerous or normal blood vessels.","661":"Cut on the hand. Lacerations of the hand can be simple involving only the skin or complex with injury to tendons, nerves and\/or blood vessels. With tendon lacerations there may be weakness of the hand and\/or fingers, and with nerve damage numbness is experienced beyond the laceration.","662":"This disorder is transmitted by the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito, and is caused by the parasite Plasmodium.  Patients usually begin having symptoms one to three weeks after the mosquito bite. The geographic distribution is Central and South America, Africa and Asia. Once inside the blood stream the parasites multiply inside the red blood cells, which then rupture within 48 to 72 hours, infecting more red blood cells. The rupturing of the red blood cells causes the classic cyclic fevers. Malaria can also be transmitted through blood transfusion, organ transplant, or shared use of injection drug equipment with an infected person. Malaria remains one of the most common diseases worldwide, killing over 400,000 people every year. There are five different types of the Plasmodium parasite with Plasmodium falciparum being most dangerous. ","663":"Tinea cruris is a fungal infection of the groin that is commonly called jock itch. It results in an itchy red rash that often develops when clothing traps moisture and heat. It is most common in athletic men, but can also affect women. In men, the penis and scrotum are not affected.","664":"Fractures of the nose are common and represent 40% of all facial fractures. Proper treatment can preserve function and aesthetics. Associated injuries commonly occur. Patients with septal hematomas (blue mass on septum), cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea (clear fluid from the nose), malocclusion (malalignment of the teeth), or extra ocular movement defects (double vision) will need their associated injuries managed in conjunction with the nasal fracture.","665":"A partial or complete collapse of a lung. The lung can develop an air leak. Air that leaks between the lung and its surrounding structures (chest wall and diaphragm) causes a separation between the lung and chest wall. This air pressure can build with each breath, and can compress and collapse the lung. When severe, this buildup of air can compress the blood vessels and decrease blood return to the heart. This is called a tension pneumothorax. If untreated the disorder can result in death. A pneumothorax can occur from trauma, spontaneously, or with coughing in a patient with lung disease such as emphysema.","666":"Swimmer's itch patients become infected by a parasite known as a flat worm. The parasite burrows into the skin of people while they swim in an infected lake. The parasites are released into the lake by infected snails. Once in the skin the patient experiences an allergic reaction causing the symptoms of redness and itching. The infections are more common in the summer months. Swimmer's itch is called cercarial dermatitis. ","667":"A telescoping of the bowel into itself that can cause a bowel obstruction and decreased blood supply to the portion of the intestine involved. It can affect all ages and both sexes, but is more common in babies 5-10 months of age. Urgent treatment is needed for this disorder to prevent an intestinal perforation, peritonitis and death. The cause of this disorder is unknown. ","668":"Asperger's syndrome is a developmental disorder that falls into the broader category of autism spectrum disorders. Some consider it a high functioning form of autism. Persons with this syndrome display social awkwardness, have limited repetitive patterns of behavior, possess a tendency to focus on one subject, and often are clumsy. Motor milestones may be delayed. There is no cure but early intervention can help the child assimilate and better function in society.","669":"A convulsion in young children caused by a rapid increase in body temperature, often from an infection. They are usually not serious but can be frightening for parents. A febrile seizure does not mean the child's brain is abnormal or that the child will develop epilepsy later in life.","67":"A medical condition caused by an improper or insufficient diet. There are many causes of this disorder but it is most often caused by insufficient eating, poor absorption of food, or excessive loss of nutrients. Malnutrition can be mild or severe. In some cases the malnutrition causes permanent damage to the organs. ","670":"Inflammation of the mucous membrane of the bronchi. The bronchi are the tubes that carry air through the lungs. Bronchitis can be acute or chronic. Acute bronchitis is usually caused by a virus. Chronic bronchitis occurs most often in current or former smokers. ","671":"Pseudomonas is a type of bacteria that can cause a variety of infections. These infections can affect almost every organ system. It often affects individuals whose immune systems have been compromised due to other diseases. Pseudomonas bacteria exist all around us. But they are most commonly found in moist environments and in soil. All age groups are affected and infections can be life-threatening.","672":"Any one of a group of diseases that may be caused by viruses or bacteria and are spread during sexual activity. They typically cause symptoms of the genitalia or urinary tract, but many are asymptomatic. They may also lead to generalized disease, particularly in the chronic form. Having more than one sexual partner increases the risk of acquiring the disease. The most common STIs are chlamydia, gonorrhea, viral hepatitis, genital herpes, HIV\/AIDS, human papillomavirus, pelvic inflammatory disease, syphilis, and trichomoniasis.","673":"A sense of fear or apprehension accompanied by some or all of the following signs: muscle tension, restlessness, palpitations, rapid breathing, jitteriness, suspicion, confusion, decreased concentration, or fear of losing control. This reaction may occur as result of a real or perceived danger or stressor. But it might occur without any clear reason. An episode may be brief or long lasting. The symptoms may go away and return repeatedly. Symptoms that persist or frequently recur define an anxiety disorder.","674":"Inflammation of the heart muscle (myocardium). The disease can be from an infection (usually viral) or from a complication of an underlying illness, injury, radiation therapy, or toxic reactions to drugs. Inflammation of the lining surrounding the heart can also occur (pericarditis). The severity of the disease can vary widely and the prognosis varies. Many people completely recover. Others have permanent heart damage and heart failure.","675":"An acute inflammatory condition of the nervous system that damages the lining of nerves (called the myelin sheath). The nerves of the body are essential and help control muscle contraction. In this disorder the nerves no longer normally transmit the impulses from the brain to the muscles causing weakness and paralysis of the muscles. Patients experience muscle weakness that begins in the lower legs and moves upward. The paralysis can prevent breathing and result in death. The exact cause of this uncommon disorder is not known. When it does occur, it often appears to be triggered by an infection and rarely some vaccines. ","676":"A liver disease that persists over a long period of time, resulting in a progressive destruction of the liver. Normal liver function is essential for many reasons, including its production of blood clotting factors and its role in detoxifying the blood. In the end stages patients experience an increased risk of excessive bleeding, especially internal bleeding and becoming confused. There are many causes with alcohol and viral infections being the most common. Hepatitis B and C are the most common viral infections related to this disorder. Less common causes of cirrhosis include autoimmune diseases, medications, hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease. ","677":"Bruises that develop when small blood vessels under the skin tear or rupture, most often from blunt injury or a crush injury. Blood leaks into tissues under the skin and causes the black-and-blue color.","678":"An anal fistula is a tunnel that connects the anal canal to the skin. If it is infected, it can cause pain, bleeding, discharge and fever. Conditions that can cause an anal fistula include Inflammatory bowel disease, certain infections, cancer, radiation and diverticulitis.","679":"Lymphedema is the build-up of lymph fluid in an area of the body. The lymph fluid normally flows through a system of canals between lymph nodes and is eventually returned to the blood stream. The fluid carries infection and foreign material away from the skin and tissue. A disruption in this normal flow results in lymphedema and abnormal swelling. The disruption can be caused by surgery, cancer, certain infections and radiation therapy. Individuals with lymphedema are at a greater risk of developing infection in the affected body part.","68":"An infection of the tear sac at the corner of the eye near the nose. The infection is usually caused by bacterial growth in a blocked tear duct. The infection can occur at any age but is more common in infants. ","680":"The rotator cuff is a band of tendons which compose a portion of the shoulder joint. The rotator cuff is composed of tendons of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and subscapularis muscles. Rotator cuff syndrome is a spectrum of diseases ranging from shoulder impingement, to inflammation (tendonitis or bursitis) to a partial or complete tear (rotator cuff tear).","681":"Glossodynia refers to a painful or burning feeling of the tongue. Glossodynia often occurs along with other conditions. They include long-term irritations of the mouth, trauma, nerve damage, dry mouth, allergies, vitamin deficiencies, tobacco use, anemia, infections, psychological conditions, and certain medicines. Glossodynia may also be a sign or symptom of burning mouth syndrome (BMS). This is a burning feeling without an obvious cause that can affect various areas of the mouth.","682":"A condition of low oxygen concentration in the blood. Adequate oxygen levels require proper function of the airways, lungs and heart. Any defect in this chain can cause low oxygen. Low oxygen may be caused by: blood infection (sepsis), lung infection (such as pneumonia), blood clots in lung (pulmonary embolus), heart failure, airway obstruction, the effects of drugs or medications, and severe head injury.","683":"A diarrheal disease caused by microscopic parasites of the genus Cryptosporidium. Both the disease and the parasite are commonly known as \"Crypto\". Infection usually occurs by ingesting the parasite and results in diarrhea. People with advanced HIV are more prone to this infection, which can cause severe symptoms. ","684":"A non-cancerous growth that involves the conjunctiva of the eye. The conjunctiva is the white part of the eye surrounding the colored part of the eye (iris). The pterygium is white to yellow in color and can grow onto the iris. They tend to grow slowly and usually do not affect the vision of the eye. Having more exposure to sun light such as living near the equator or working outside increases the likelihood of developing pterygium. The disorder occurs twice as often in males as females and is rarely seen before the age of 20.","685":"Aspirin overdose can occur accidentally or intentionally. There is also an acute form and a chronic form. Chronic overdoses are more common in the elderly.","686":"Cut on the foot. Lacerations of the foot can be simple involving only the skin or complex with injury to tendons, nerves and\/or blood vessels. With tendon lacerations there is weakness of the foot or toes, and with nerve damage numbness is experienced beyond the laceration.","687":"Somatization disorder is the development of and preoccupation with physical symptoms that cannot be fully explained based on medical testing. The symptoms develop over years and can lead to impairment in normal daily functioning. The symptoms are varied and involve many different areas of the body. The person with somatization disorder has real symptoms and is simply not \"faking it.\" It is thought that the symptoms may be the result of abnormal brain function or emotional regulation. Individuals with the disorder often have depression and anxiety as well.","688":"Hemangiomas are the abnormal buildup of blood vessels in the skin or internal organs. They are benign growths and do not metastasize (grow beyond their boundaries). The majority of hemangiomas are located on the head and neck. They are more common in twin births, females and Caucasians.","689":"Bacterial tracheitis is a bacterial infection of the trachea (windpipe). It is most common in young children but can affect individuals up to age sixteen. Symptoms may be similar to croup but are more severe. Bacterial tracheitis is a relatively rare disease. However, it is a serious infection and requires prompt medical attention. ","69":"A cancer that may involve the skin, mouth, throat, nose, intestines, liver, and lung. The abnormal growth occurs in the cells that line blood vessels and lymphatic channels. The cancer cells can grow rapidly. This type of cancer is most often found in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and in those on immunosuppressive medications. Another form occurs in elderly men of Mediterranean ancestry.","690":"A malignant cancer that usually develops from the skin or the mucous lining of the body cavities. It can occur in the skin, sinuses, lips, mouth, esophagus, urinary bladder, prostate, lungs, vagina, and cervix. The severity of this cancer is determined by the location, size when it is found, and the general health of the patient. ","691":"A solitary bump just underneath the skin, which may be white or light in color. This kind of cyst is filled with thick white or yellow waxy material made up of keratin, sebum and skin debris. They are found on the trunk, face, neck and scalp. They can become inflamed and infected. Infected cysts become tender and red.","692":"Inflammation of the mucus membranes of the nose and upper respiratory tract can occur in response to an irritant. In allergic rhinitis, the immune system in the nose reacts strongly to irritants called airborne allergens. This is a common disorder, affecting at least a quarter of the population.","693":"Skin condition that presents with a rash mostly along the face, ears, and scalp. This disorder is not systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), although some patients with SLE will also have discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE). A small percentage of patients with DLE will also develop SLE. The skin changes may appear red, patchy, scaling, and crusting. Exposure to sunlight may cause the symptoms to worsen. The disorder is rare. Women are more often affected than men. Most patients are between the ages of 20 and 40 years old. The cause of DLE is not known.","694":"A genetic disorder that causes developmental delays, mental retardation and other difficulties. The disorder occurs in 1 in 700 births and is the most common condition causing severe learning disabilities. The cause of the disorder is an extra chromosome 21 (trisomy) or extra genetic material on the 21st chromosome. Advanced maternal age and having a previous child with Down syndrome increases the likelihood of having another child with the condition. Children with this disorder have an increased risk of heart defects, leukemia, infections, sleep apnea, and have a decreased life expectancy.","695":"Flat feet means a flattening of the arch on the inside sole of your feet. It is a common and usually painless condition that is often congenital and identified before adulthood. However, when the arches flatten over time and are painful, this may be due to ligament damage and can cause foot or ankle pain.","696":"A cancer that involves the front part of the throat. This area is called the oropharynx. The oropharynx begins where the oral cavity stops. It includes the base of the tongue, the soft palate, the tonsils, and the side and back wall of the throat. There are many different cell types in these areas and different cancers can develop from each type of cell. Some of these cancers are benign and others are malignant.","697":"A compression of the bones (vertebra) in the neck or back. These fractures are named by which vertebra in the spine are involved. There are 7 neck or cervical vertebrae, 12 in the middle of the back called thoracic vertebrae, and 5 in the lower back referred to as lumbar vertebrae. These fractures typically occur when a vertical force is applied to the head, feet or buttocks which causes a compression of the spine. This disorder is more common in the elderly population who have less calcium in their bones (osteopenia or osteoporosis).I In these patients the fracture can occur from something as minor as sitting down too hard. Compression fractures are graded by how much loss of height has occurred to the vertebra. A loss of half is called a 50% compression fracture. If the fracture is severe the bone fragments can enter the spinal canal and damage the spinal cord resulting in paralysis. ","698":"Occurs when air leaks into the area between the lungs and chest wall (pleural space). At times air can only enter this space and not exit, and with each breath air can be forced into this space causing the pressure in the collapsed space to increase. This pressure can become high enough to prevent normal functioning of the heart resulting in low blood pressure and if not treated immediately result in death. The most common cause of tension pneumothorax is trauma.","699":"Ecstasy is an amphetamine and takes effect 30 minutes after oral intake. Symptoms include anxiety and increased heart rate, followed by euphoria and relaxation. Users report increased sensory tactile enhancements and mild visual distortions. Symptoms usually resolve after 3-4 hours. Ecstasy toxicity has been associated with seizures, abnormalities of heart rhythm, heart failure, stroke, and kidney failure and\/or liver failure.","7":"Endometrial cancer is the most common cancer of the uterus and is an abnormal growth of endometrial cells which line the uterus. It is associated with an increased level of estrogen. It is most commonly diagnosed in women between the ages of 60 and 70. Other conditions that increase the risk of having this disorder include: periods beginning prior to age 12, infertility or never having been pregnant, becoming pregnant early in life, polycystic ovarian syndrome, obesity, starting menopause late in life, taking estrogen medications after menopause without also taking progesterone, and certain hormone treatments for breast cancer (such as tamoxifen).\r\n","70":"Inflammation of the ear drum (tympanic membrane) caused by a bacterial or viral infection. Bullous myringitis is a particular type of middle ear infection that causes painful pimples (vesicles) on the ear drum. The bacteria and viruses that cause this condition are similar to those that cause the more common middle ear infections. ","700":"Marijuana is primarily smoked but can be ingested as well. Its intoxicating effects include relaxation, sleepiness, and mild euphoria. It may help relieve nausea and improve appetite. Marijuana can cause undesirable side effects, which increase with higher doses.","701":"Elevated blood pressure without a known cause (also called primary hypertension). It occurs when the systolic pressure is consistently over 140 mm Hg, or the diastolic blood pressure is consistently over 90 mm Hg. Blood pressure is determined by the amount of blood pumped, by the actions of the heart, and by the size and condition of the arteries. Untreated high blood pressure can cause narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and result in heart attacks, strokes, and kidney disease.","702":"High blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. This elevation in the pressure makes the right side of the heart work harder, and can cause the heart to fail. It can result from a problem in the pulmonary vessels themselves (Primary Pulmonary Hypertension), or from a problem outside the vessels (Secondary Pulmonary Hypertension). Secondary causes include: pulmonary embolus, COPD (emphysema or chronic bronchitis), autoimmune diseases, CHF (heart failure), and sleep apnea.","703":"A chronic condition that may cause inflammation of the skin of the legs, trunk, arms, wrists, scalp, penis, lining of the mouth, vagina, toe-nails and fingernails. The rash comes and goes and is itchy, mildly swollen and red or purplish. It is most common in adults over 40, but can affect people of any age. The cause of this disorder is not known but in some cases it seems to be triggered by viral hepatitis (liver inflammation) or allergic reactions.","704":"The vertebrae are the bones in the neck and back. Fractures are broken bones. The severity of a vertebral fracture depends on the location and whether or not the fracture affects the spinal cord. The most common fracture is a compression fracture of the lower thoracic and lumbar spine. These commonly occur in elderly patients and can be the result of minor trauma such as sitting down too hard. Vertebral fractures can be true emergencies if the spinal cord is injured. Symptoms of weakness, numbness and\/or loss of bowel or bladder control require an immediate evaluation.","705":"Bee stings result in local redness, swelling and pain. Rarely an infection called cellulitis can develop. If the patient has a severe allergy, life-threatening swelling and low blood pressure can occur.","706":"Head injuries range from minor trauma to concussions, unconsciousness and death. Traumatic injury to the brain can cause bleeding on the surface of the brain or within the brain. The brain can be permanently damaged by this trauma. Coma occurs when the central portion of the brain is unable to activate or stimulate the rest of the brain to wakefulness or when there is extensive injury to the brain. Head injuries can also produce fractures of the skull. Depressed skull fractures can cause a piece of bone to penetrate or deform the brain. Basilar skull fractures involve the base of the skull. They can injure the nerves that pass through these regions and produce cerebrospinal fluid leaks.","707":"The epiglottis is a small flap of tissue that hangs down from the back of the throat. It helps protect the airway during swallowing by preventing food or liquid from entering the trachea. The epiglottis can become infected or inflamed (epiglottitis) causing swelling. The swelling can block the airway and result in death. Airway blockage is more common in children. The bacteria Haemophilus influenzae is the most common cause of epiglottitis. Since childhood vaccination for Haemophilus influenzae became common the number of cases of epiglottitis has decreased. ","708":"Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is inflammation of the joints that occurs before the age of seventeen that is present for at least 6 weeks. It is most likely an auto-immune disorder. For some reason, the body begins to look at part of itself as foreign material like a virus or bacteria. In juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, the body attacks the lining inside joints causing inflammation and damage.","709":"Isopropyl alcohol is commonly used as a disinfectant, antifreeze, and solvent, and typically comprises 70 percent of \"rubbing alcohol\". Ingestions occur accidentally, as a substitute for alcohol, or as a suicide attempt. Ingestions usually cause drunkenness and when severe can cause cardiopulmonary collapse and death. Rarely bleeding from the stomach occurs after an ingestion.","71":"Occurs when the wall of the aorta becomes torn or divided and blood dissects between the layers of the blood vessel. The aorta is the largest artery in the body and it carries oxygenated blood away from the heart. As the vessel wall is damaged, the openings to other important arteries can become occluded causing strokes, heart attacks or other serious organ damage. The aorta can burst causing the patient to quickly bleed to death. Dissections are usually caused from atherosclerotic disease and high blood pressure or because of congenitally abnormal elastic tissue. The dissection can occur in the aorta in the chest (thoracic), in the abdominal aorta, or in both the chest and the abdomen.","710":"A stab wound to the knee. These wounds can damage structures deep to the skin such as blood vessels, nerves, or tendons. The object that caused the wound can carry bacteria or foreign material deep into the wound and cause infections. Puncture wounds from animal or human bites are especially prone to infections. ","711":"A posterior cruciate ligament injury is an injury to one of the bands of tissue that connects the femur (thigh bone) to the tibia (shin bone). Along with the anterior cruciate ligament, the two ligaments form an \"x\" in the center of the knee. The degree of injury may vary. Some injuries may result in sprains (stretch\/slight tear), while others may result in complete tears of the ligament. The ligament is frequently injured by a forceful blow to the front of the tibia (shin bone). This may occur during a motor vehicle accident or as the result of a blow sustained during a contact sport.","712":"A seasonal disruption of mood. Symptoms appear in the winter beginning in September and resolve in the spring. Patients experience depression and a general lack of energy. The amount of light exposure is felt to be part of the cause and light is used in the treatment. The disorder is more common in women. ","713":"A skin infection caused by a fungus, not a worm. Fungus infections also can affect skin on the body (tinea corporis), groin area (tinea cruris, also called jock itch), or feet (tinea pedis, also called athlete's foot). There can be several patches of ringworm on the skin at once. The name comes from the characteristic rash: a red ring surrounding an area of normal appearing skin. The form involving the scalp is most often seen in children. The infection can be acquired through contact with infected humans, infected animals, or from contact with objects containing the fungus such as bedding, clothes, or hair brushes.","714":"An abnormally high concentration of potassium in the blood. Potassium is an important electrolyte in the body and high levels can cause the heart and muscles to function improperly and result in death. Common causes are kidney failure and medications.","715":"Ticks are related to spiders. There are over 800 different types of ticks. Tick bites are more common during April through September. Ticks attach themselves to the skin and drink blood in the skin. Most ticks can be easily removed using tweezers and do not require other treatment. Some ticks carry germs than can cause serious diseases such as: Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, Tick Paralysis, and Tick Borne Encephalitis. A person's risk of getting one of these diseases is associated with where they live in the US.","716":"A kind of arthritis caused by an autoimmune disease. Rheumatoid arthritis causes pain and swelling in joints, but can also cause a variety of other symptoms. The disorder causes swelling and damage to the lining of the joints (synovium) producing the joint pain and joint destruction experienced. It most often occurs between the ages 20 and 60 and is 3 times more common in women than men.","717":"An inflammation and infection of the lung caused by breathing in contents from the mouth or stomach. Material such as food, vomit, mucous, saliva or other substances from the mouth enter the airways and lung tissue causing inflammation and an infection. This disorder is more common in patients who are intoxicated, confused, have swallowing problems or have had a stroke. The bacteria that cause this type of lung infection are different than the organisms that normally cause pneumonia. ","718":"An infection of the knee joint, usually caused by bacteria. The bacteria can enter the joint by traveling through the blood or by direct entrance into the joint from trauma. The infection can cause permanent destruction of the joint if left untreated. Previous joint surgery or a depressed immune system increases the risk of the disorder.","719":"A slow growing skin cancer that is caused from exposure to the sun. Basal cells are a type of cell in the skin. This skin cancer is most often found on the neck, face, back and arms since these areas are exposed to the sun. Having fair skin and a family history of skin cancer also puts a patient at increased risk of this disorder. Protecting the skin from the sun with hats, clothing and sunscreen is the best way to avoid getting this cancer. It is rare for this type of cancer to spread to other areas of the body (metastasize) but the tumor can do significant damage to local areas if it is not treated.","72":"A disorder of the middle ear that causes dizziness, room spinning (vertigo), and nausea\/vomiting. The symptoms become worse with head movement, and lessen by keeping the eyes closed. Vestibular neuronitis can occur during an ear infection or an upper respiratory infection. Sometimes no cause is determined. The symptoms usually resolve after a few days. Also known as labyrinthitis.","720":"An infection of the ear canal (from the ear lobe to the ear drum.) Getting water in the ears can make this infection more likely to occur. Otitis externa is also called swimmer's ear. Diabetics are at increased risk. This infection can also occur after scratching of the ear canal by a cotton swab or other item. Usually the infection is bacterial. Some long-lasting cases can involve yeast (fungus).","721":"Produces too many ketones in the blood resulting in the blood becoming too acidotic. The syndrome occurs most often in people that drink very heavily (binge drinking), don't eat and have persistent vomiting. The vomiting can result in severe dehydration, which can worsen the effects of the acidosis.","722":"An autoimmune disorder that causes the thyroid gland to produce too much thyroid hormone (thyroxine). Over production of thyroxine is called hyperthyroidism and Graves' disease is the most common cause of natural hyperthyroidism. Graves' disease occurs when the body produces antibodies that attack the thyroid gland causing it to enlarge (goiter) and overproduce the thyroid hormone. The disorder is more common in women. The majority of the symptoms experienced are the result of the hyperthyroidism. Graves' disease also causes swelling of the eye muscles and the characteristic protruding of the eyes.","723":"An inflammatory skin condition that results in a red, flaky rash in the areas of the body where the sebaceous glands are most common (face, scalp and groin). In infants, it occurs primarily on the scalp and is referred to as cradle cap. It is thought that tiny yeast on the skin may play a role in the development of seborrheic dermatitis.","724":"A hole in the gastrointestinal tract, also called a perforation. The gastrointestinal tract begins at the mouth and includes the esophagus, small and large intestines, and ends at the anus. A perforation can develop anywhere along this path. Common causes include: ulcer, severe intestinal blockage, trauma, or cancer. It can be life threatening, and usually requires a surgical repair.","725":"A stab wound to the hand. These wounds can damage structures deep to the skin such as blood vessels, nerves, or tendons. The object that caused the wound can carry bacteria or foreign material deep into the wound and cause infections. Puncture wounds from animal or human bites are especially prone to infections. ","726":"Pain caused by irritation and spasm of the gallbladder or tubes (ducts) that connect the gallbladder to the intestine. The gallbladder is an organ next to the liver that contains bile. Most often, biliary colic occurs when the bile forms a gallstone, and the gallstone blocks one of the bile ducts of the gallbladder. Not all gallstones cause pain and some patients have gallstones without any symptoms. Sometimes gallstones can cause serious infections of the gallbladder (cholecystitis). Gallstones are usually made up of cholesterol or bile. Gallstones are more common in Hispanics, women, women with multiple pregnancies, obesity, age greater than 40, and in families with a history of gallstones.","727":"A type of influenza (flu) virus that normally only infects birds. One particular bird flu, called H5N1, is common in birds around the world, but only rarely gets passed to humans, or from one human to another. However, when humans do get infected with this virus, they often become very seriously ill. The virus is almost always passed to humans when they handle sick birds. Bird flu outbreaks have occurred in Asia, Africa and parts of Europe. Bird flu is also known as avian influenza. ","728":"Scurvy is a condition caused by a decreased amount of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) in the body. Vitamin C helps the body make collagen (a protein that helps wounds heal, cartilage form and bone strengthen). Vitamin C also helps the immune system function. Increased bleeding is a hallmark of this disease.  Vitamin C can be obtained from many foods such as citrus fruits (like oranges), citrus juices, and many other fruits and vegetables. Scurvy is rare in the United States.  Scurvy can be caused by malnutrition, alcoholism or eating disorders. People with scurvy can develop anemia. If left untreated, scurvy can be fatal.","729":"The epididymis is a long coiled tubular structure located next to each testicle. Inflammation of the epididymis may produce testicular pain and fever. Infection is the most common cause and the bacteria normally come from the urethra or bladder.","73":"A phenomenon in which people only have elevated blood pressure readings in the doctor's office and not when measured outside the clinical arena. The cause is thought to be anxiety produced by the clinic visit.","730":"A symptom of overeating that is not related to normal caloric needs. Patients have an increased appetite and an excess desire for food. Diabetes is a common cause of this symptom.","731":"A blunt injury to the finger can result in pain and swelling of the nail bed and finger. If no blood develops under the nail (subungual hematoma) the injury is called a nail contusion.","732":"Inflammation, swelling and infection of the armpit, groin, buttocks or under the breast. Tender bumps develop and can turn into a collection of pus (abscess). The area is painful, warm to touch and can drain foul smelling yellow fluid. The inflammation begins after the sweat glands in the affected area become clogged allowing bacteria to infect the skin and sweat glands. Hydradenitis suppurativa usually begins after puberty and can be recurrent. If the condition is not treated chronic scarring and a surrounding skin infection can occur called cellulitis. Sometimes cellulitis can be life threatening. ","733":"Occurs because of a weakened area of muscle. This weakened area cannot hold in the abdominal contents and it protrudes, or herniates, through the defect. The hernia can contain fat, intestines or other tissue. Typically the hernia protrudes with any activity that increases the pressure in the abdomen such as lifting a heavy object or straining to have a bowel movement. Often, the protrusion will relieve itself or can be gently pushed back in place. If the herniated contents become stuck in the defect it is called an incarcerated hernia. Some incarcerated hernias can cause a blockage of the intestines (bowel obstruction). If an incarcerated hernia is not relieved, the contents of the hernia can swell, lose its blood supply and die. This type of hernia is called a strangulated hernia. The most serious strangulated hernias contain intestine and if untreated can lead to a hole in the intestine and a life threatening infection (peritonitis). The most common type of hernia is in the groin (inguinal hernia or femoral hernia). Other types of hernias are in previous surgical sites (incisional hernias), in the abdominal wall (ventral hernias), and around the belly button (umbilical hernia). ","734":"A cancer of the bone marrow affecting mainly older adults. The bone marrow is in the center of bones, and is where blood cells are made. The blood contains red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. There are five different kinds of white blood cells. One type is called a plasma cell and these cells make antibodies that help fight infections. In multiple myeloma the body makes too many plasma cells and these cells can produce too many antibodies. This overgrowth of plasma cells can cause low numbers of red blood cells (anemia), low numbers of platelets (thrombocytopenia), and lower numbers of normal white blood cells. Not having enough platelets can cause patients to bleed easily, and low numbers of white blood cells results in increased infections. This disorder can also damage the kidneys, and produce brittle bones resulting in increased fractures. ","735":"An arterial expansion in the cavernous sinus. The cavernous sinus is one of the venous channels draining blood away from the brain. The carotid artery and cranial nerves pass through this sinus. The cavernous sinus is located at the base of the skull, behind the eyes. An aneurysm (arterial expansion) in the sinus can cause visual problems and headache; if it ruptures, the affected individual may have a red, bulging eye. ","736":"Small bowel cancer is the growth of abnormal cells in a portion of the small intestine. These abnormal cells ultimately grow and produce a tumor. This cancer is relatively rare compared to stomach and colorectal cancer. The cancer behaves somewhat differently depending on its location in the small bowel. Cancers in the first third of the small intestine (duodenum) tend to behave more like stomach cancer while cancers in the next two-thirds of the small intestine (jejunum and ileum) tend to behave more like colorectal cancer. Smoking, excessive alcohol intake, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, and familial polyposis syndrome increase the risk of small bowel cancer.","737":"Having grooves in the tongue is called fissured tongue. Fissures can appear at any age. As with wrinkles, the grooves can become more noticeable with age.","738":"An infection that occurs in the nose caused by the fungus, Rhinosporidium seeberi. It produces a nasal mass that slowly enlarges over months or years. With time it may cause airway obstruction. Although there have been cases in the United States it is most often seen in India and Sri Lanka.","739":"Spinal cord tumors can be primary and arise from the spinal cord or its linings, or secondary and come from cancer that has spread from other parts of the body (metastases). Symptoms arise when the tumor compresses the spinal cord or nerve roots of the spinal cord. The severity and location of the symptoms depend on the location and size of the tumor in the spinal cord.","74":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland. The prostate surrounds the urethra and is located in the pelvis. The urethra is a tube that carries urine from the bladder to the penis. As the prostate enlarges it compresses the urethra making urination difficult. This disorder occurs in almost all men as they age, although some men experience worse symptoms than others.","740":"Caused by fungi (coccidiomycosis) that live in the soil and are spread into the air during wind storms, construction or farming. The fungi spores are breathed in causing a lung infection. Also called valley fever because of its high incidence in the San Joaquin Valley. Pregnant women and people with a weak immune system are especially at risk. Mild cases go away on their own; but some people will need anti-fungal medication.","741":"Atherosclerosis is the buildup of fat deposits that harden (plaque) inside arteries. This leads to narrowing of those vessels and eventually decreased blood flow to vital organs. If the blood flow is decreased significantly or is blocked completely, the supplied organs can suffer serious damage (heart attack, stroke, etc.). There are many risk factors for developing atherosclerosis. They include diabetes, smoking, high total and LDL cholesterol, high blood pressure, inactivity, family history and obesity.","742":"Factor V Leiden deficiency is an inherited disorder that results in the increased risk of clot formation in the body (hypercoagulable state). Normally, factor V helps promote the formation of a clot and is broken down by a protein called protein C. In this disorder, a genetic mutation causes the factor V that is produced to be abnormal. The factor V cannot be easily broken down by protein C and therefore, produces more clots than usual. It is most common in Caucasians, less common in African-Americans and Hispanics, and rare in Asians. It is estimated that up to 5% of Caucasians in North America have the deficiency. An individual's clotting risk increases with smoking and the use of birth control pills.","743":"A psychiatric diagnosis having characteristics of schizophrenia and affective disorder (depression). Patients experience psychosis, such as hallucinations or delusions, and symptoms of elevated or depressed mood. Untreated, patients become disenfranchised and are unable to hold jobs or perform their normal daily responsibilities.","744":"Glossitis is an inflammatory disorder of the tongue that leads to a smooth red and glossy tongue.  It has multiple causes including vitamin deficiencies, dry mouth, thrush (yeast infection) and celiac disease.  Glossitis causes a burning sensation and sensitivity to salt and acidic foods.  Treatment is directed towards the cause.","745":"A viral infection that usually begins in the throat. It can also involve the upper palate, tonsils, skin, gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. Infants and young children (under 3 years old) are most commonly affected. The disease is most often caused by the Coxsackie virus A16. Coxsackie virus is a type of enterovirus. Other enteroviruses can also cause hand foot and mouth disease. The disorder gets its name because it causes a red rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet along with painful blisters in the mouth. The virus is most commonly spread from human to human through contact with contaminated feces, infected saliva, mucous, or respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing.  People are most contagious during the first week of illness, and can still spread the virus for up to 3-8 weeks even if no symptoms are present. ","746":"Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder caused by the abnormal growth of a certain type of white blood cell called histiocytes. Langerhans cells are found in the skin, lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow and lungs. They normally help fight off infection but, in this disease, their abnormal growth causes tissue damage and inflammation. The exact cause of this disorder is unknown. In the majority of cases, diagnosis occurs in childhood or early adulthood.","747":"Hypochondriasis is the preoccupation with fears of serious illness. Normal sensations or minor physical complaints are interpreted as symptoms of grave disease. Medical reassurance and even medical workups often do not allay illness fears. Hypochondriasis is associated with other psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression.","748":"Calcium is an essential electrolyte in the blood. It can be found bound to proteins in the blood such as albumin or exist free as ionized calcium. The body's metabolism of calcium is complex and dependent on hormones (parathyroid hormone, calcitonin), vitamin D, and other electrolytes (magnesium and phosphate). Hypocalcemia can be a life threatening problem and may cause muscle spasms, an abnormal heart rhythm, fainting, and seizures. This disorder can be caused by a number of conditions, including: low levels of parathyroid hormone, vitamin D deficiency, a complication of thyroid surgery, pancreatitis, kidney failure, cancer, severe infection (sepsis), with certain medications, elevated magnesium levels, and with chemotherapy.","749":"A foreign material in a cut. The most common foreign bodies are gravel, small rocks, sand, glass, and wood. If the foreign body is not removed an infection of the wound can occur. The best way to remove a foreign body in a wound is to clean the area with running water. The healthcare provider will examine the wound and try to visualize any material after the wound has been cleaned. Sometimes an x-ray or CT scan is helpful in detecting a foreign body lying underneath the surface of the skin. ","75":"Dysthymia is the old name for persistent depressive disorder (PDD). It\u2019s a form of depression that is less severe than major depression but usually lasts longer. Many people with this type of depression describe having been depressed as long as they can remember, or they feel they are going in and out of depression all the time. Symptoms usually begin slowly in adolescence or early adult life. Dysthymia does tend to run in families. People with dysthymia have a greater than average chance of developing major depression.","750":"Large cell lung cancer is the  growth of abnormal cells in the lung. These abnormal cells increase in number  and produce a tumor. Large cell lung cancers tend to grow in the central part of the lung and can spread rapidly. Current or previous smokers are at greatest risk for development of this type of cancer. ","751":"Characterized by spasms of the coronary (heart) arteries causing decreased blood flow. The lack of blood causes chest pain and can result in a heart attack. In this condition the patient's coronary arteries do not have any fixed blockages (such as cholesterol plaques). Certain drugs or medications (cocaine, ergotamine) can trigger the events. Most events occur without a known trigger.","752":"Tiny insects that live on the scalp. They feed on the blood of the infected person and are easily spread by close contact with other people. The infection can also be contracted through contact with infected furniture or by sharing brushes or bedding. There are several types of lice. Head lice live in the hair of the scalp, or eyebrows. Other types include body and pubic lice.","753":"The withdrawal from estrogen hormone replacement can cause symptoms similar to menopause in an abbreviated time period and may be uncomfortable.","754":"Caused by the bacteria Mycoplasma genitalium and is a common sexually transmitted infection. It often does not cause any symptoms. Men may get a urethritis with painful urination and a penile discharge. Women may have a vaginal discharge, cervix inflammation or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can cause sterility.","755":"A partial or complete interruption of impulse transmission from the small chambers of the heart (atrium) to the large chambers of the heart (ventricles). The most common causes are medications, a heart attack, electrolyte abnormalities (such as high blood potassium level), and scarring of the conduction system. The most common drugs causing this disorder are calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers and digoxin. The blocked impulses result in an abnormally slow heart rate. This disorder can be very serious and if untreated result in death.","756":"A forceful twisting of the ankle causing the ligaments in the ankle to be torn. No bones are broken. The most common twisting motion is inward (called an inversion injury). This causes most of the damage to the outside of the ankle. Most injuries heal with a simple ace wrap or air splint. Severe injuries may need surgical repair. Sometimes the ligament above the ankle called the syndesmosis ligament can be injured as well. This injury is called a high ankle sprain. High ankle sprains generally take longer to heal.","757":"Chondromalacia is the softening of cartilage that exists inside the joints. Normally this cartilage acts as a cushion that allows the bones to easily slide over one another. As the cartilage softens and weakens, areas develop that allow the bones to rub together and cause pain. The knee is the most common joint to be affected. Several conditions increase the risk of development of chondromalacia. They include trauma, overuse, infections, rheumatoid arthritis, meniscus injuries and steroid injections in the joint.","758":"Backward flow of contents from the stomach into the esophagus causes gastroesophageal reflux or heartburn. The digestive fluid in the stomach irritates the lining of the esophagus, and over a long period of time can cause esophageal damage, including narrowing (stricture) and a condition called Barrett's esophagus (a precancerous change in the cells of the lower esophagus). Lying flat while sleeping may worsen the symptoms. ","759":"It causes scaly patches on a baby's scalp. Cradle cap is also called infantile seborrheic dermatitis. The disorder is not serious and usually resolves on its own in 1-3 months. Rarely medicated lotions are prescribed for persistent cases.","76":"A stab wound to the mouth. The object that caused the wound can carry bacteria or foreign material deep into the wound and cause infections. Puncture wounds from animal or human bites are especially prone to infections. Facial infections can be severe causing nerve damage and extension of the infection into the brain.","760":"A change in awareness of a person's surroundings and\/or impaired mental functioning. Also known as altered mental status. Treatable causes include: infection, adverse drug reaction, very high or very low blood sugar, low oxygen level, a blood electrolyte imbalance. ","761":"Swelling of the ear can arise from trauma, inflammation, an allergic reaction, or infection. Ear swelling from trauma can result in permanent disfigurement called a cauliflower ear if the disorder is not treated appropriately. ","762":"A severe sunburn that can become fatal if not treated appropriately. It occurs from widespread and severe damage to the skin from the sun. Blistering can become severe and lead to dehydration from the loss of fluid when the blisters burst. The disorder is rare.","763":"An inflammatory condition that affects the cartilaginous portions of the ribs and causes chest pain. It affects one or more ribs, most commonly the second or third ribs, especially where these ribs meet the breastbone (sternum). The pain that is produced is sharp and often intensified by change of position of the ribs, such as lying down, bending over, coughing or sneezing. Symptoms may be confused with that of coronary artery disease or a heart attack.","764":"Chemicals that touch the skin can lead to a reaction on the skin. Some can be absorbed and affect the body as well. A chemical reaction should be suspected when a reaction occurs after a new exposure to any chemical. It is often seen immediately, but can be seen after long term use. Consider a chemical burn in children with a new unexplained skin reaction. Keep all chemicals out of reach of children to prevent occurrence. ","765":"The bite is poisonous causing pain, and ulceration at the site. The scientific name for the brown recluse is Loxosceles reclusa. In the United States, this spider is most commonly found in the South and Central states. The spider has been found in several large cities outside this range and prefers dark, sheltered areas. The spiders have a characteristic violin pattern on the back of the body part to which the legs attach (cephalothorax), and the base of the violin is oriented toward the head of the spider. They are 1\/4 to 1\/2 inch in size and yellowish-tan to dark brown in color.","766":"Facial swelling can result from trauma, infection, allergic reaction, fluid retention secondary to kidney disease, excessive blood cortisol level (Cushingoid face), or a tumor. Inflammation can cause facial swelling without these conditions if due to an autoimmune disease.","767":"Beriberi is a syndrome caused by a thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. All of the body\u2019s tissues need thiamine, including the brain. People cannot produce thiamine. They can only get it from food or supplements. Thiamine is present in  many foods such as dried beans, peas and soybeans, meat, poultry, whole grain cereals and nuts. In the United States, breads and cereals are often fortified with thiamine. People suffering from alcoholism have an increased risk of developing thiamine deficiency. Thiamine deficiency can lead to serious conditions such as heart failure, nerve and brain damage (Wernicke\u2019s  encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome). If left untreated, thiamine deficiency can be fatal.","768":"The spleen is located in the left upper abdomen under the ribs. This organ removes old red blood cells from the blood and holds red blood cells for emergency use by the body. The spleen is also important in fighting infection: it removes bacteria covered by antibodies against the bacteria that are made by the immune system. The spleen is the most commonly injured organ after blunt trauma such as a motor vehicle accident, falling, or after being hit in the abdomen. It can also be damaged from a gunshot wound or stabbing. The spleen filters about 10% of the blood supply every minute and injuries can cause a great deal of bleeding into the abdomen. Failure to get rapid treatment can result in death. People without a spleen are more susceptible to infections later in life. People with mononucleosis are more likely to suffer splenic rupture. The patient should usually avoid contact sports until cleared by his or her doctor. ","769":"A tear in the lining of the lower anal canal. Most anal fissures happen when a large, hard stool overstretches the anal opening and tears the delicate inner lining.","77":"Confusion, agitation, and abnormal arm and leg movements caused by liver failure (cirrhosis). The disease is caused by the buildup of toxic substances that are normally cleared by the liver, such as ammonia. The disorder is triggered by dehydration, eating too much protein, bleeding from the intestinal tract, infections, kidney failure, low oxygen levels, or surgery.","770":"The monthly bleeding that occurs when the lining of a women's uterus sheds its lining. This process is also called a period or menses. Only women who are still ovulating menstruate. The typical menstrual period lasts 3-5 days.","771":"An infection due to parasitic worms that affect over 100 million people worldwide. The disease is found in the tropics and sub-tropics of Asia, Africa, the Western Pacific, and parts of the Caribbean and South America. These parasites are transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito and develop into adult worms in the lymphatic vessels, causing severe damage and swelling (lymphedema).","772":"A normal adult heart beats between 60 and 100 times a minute. A heart rate over 100 beats a minute is called tachycardia. Tachycardia can be the result of a normal physiologic response such as running. When it occurs at rest it is usually considered abnormal. There are many causes but can be divided into primary and secondary. Primary causes are from problems in the heart such as abnormally beating cells. Secondary causes are from a reaction to a stress on the body such as dehydration or infection. ","773":"Weakness caused by the bite of a tick. The saliva of the tick contains a toxin that attacks nerves (neurotoxin) that innervate muscles. The paralysis usually starts in the legs and spreads upward. Removal of the tick is the cure. If untreated the disorder can result in respiratory failure and death.","774":"Caused by low levels of iron in the body. Anemia is defined as not having enough of the red blood cells that carry oxygen. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia. Iron is a necessary component of hemoglobin, and hemoglobin is the protein that carries oxygen. The major causes of iron deficiency are from blood loss, heavy menstrual periods, poor absorption of iron in the intestinal tract, and lack of iron in the diet. ","775":"Characterized by an excessive preoccupation with a real or imagined defect in a patient's physical appearance. The cause of this disorder is not known but felt to represent a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Body dysmorphic disorder can lead to anxiety, phobias, and depression, sometimes with suicidal thoughts and actions.","776":"Psychosis is a broad psychiatric term that describes a mental state in which an individual has lost the ability to distinguish between real and unreal thoughts and sensations. Having bizarre and false beliefs (delusions), seeing and hearing things that do not exist (hallucinations), and keeping one's body in a fixed position (catatonia) can occur during a psychotic episode. Individuals who experiment with illicit drugs and those with psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, depression and bipolar disorder are at risk for psychosis. Although uncommon, patients experiencing a psychotic episode can be dangerous and hurt themselves and other people. ","777":"A type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) involving damage to the air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs. The most common cause of the disorder is smoking. The walls of the alveoli become destroyed decreasing a patient's ability to get oxygen into the blood. If patients continue to smoke the destruction becomes worse resulting in the need for chronic oxygen use, eventual damage to the heart, and lung failure. ","778":"Presbyopia is the difficulty focusing on objects that are close due to a hardening of the lens in the eye. The lens naturally begins to harden as we age. This hardening begins earlier in life and usually progresses slowly. Symptoms most often begin around age forty.","779":"Cold sores and fever blisters are caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). This virus is passed from person to person by saliva or by skin contact. Cold sores usually appear as clusters of tiny blisters on the lip. About 8 out of 10 people have the virus that causes cold sores.  Most people are first infected before they are 10 years old. After this first infection, the virus remains dormant (inactive) in the nerves of the face. It can become active again and cause cold sores because of stress, illness, trauma, dental treatment, or sun exposure. HSV-1 can cause serious illness in people with weak immune systems or those who have health problems.","78":"A corneal ulcer is an inflammation and erosion of an area of the cornea (clear dome shaped window on front of eye). A corneal ulcer can be sight-threatening and requires urgent medical attention. Corneal ulcers can be caused by infection, especially in contact lens wearers, or may be a symptom of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, polyarteritis nodosa and systemic lupus erythematosus. ","780":"Characterized by the appearance of tissue that normally lines the uterus (endometrium) outside the uterine cavity. This tissue may be found on the surface of the ovary, behind the uterus, in the abdominal cavity, on the intestinal wall and even at sites further away. The disorder causes pain and can result in infertility.","781":"A cancer in the pancreas. The pancreas is the organ in the abdomen that produces insulin and digestive juices. Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of death from cancer in the US and greater than 50% of all patients with this cancer die from the cancer. The most dangerous pancreatic cancer is called \"adenocarcinoma\".  Endocrine tumors are another kind of pancreatic cancer and these are not as dangerous.","782":"Stress headaches, also called tension headaches, are very common with 30-80% of adults experiencing this type of headache. They most commonly produce pain diffusely over the head and the back of the neck. They are triggered by tight neck muscles that pull against the scalp (apply \"tension,\" as in \"tension headache). Tensing of muscles can be a reaction to stress, which is one reason this headache has been named \"stress headache.\" Tension headaches are considered chronic when they occur at least twice a week for several months.","783":"A curvature of the spine that can cause pain, disability, and occasionally respiratory problems. The cause of the disorder is generally not known although it can run in families. Scoliosis is usually diagnosed in childhood. Treatment depends on the severity of the curvature and any other symptoms being experienced.","784":"Suicide is the act of killing oneself. Suicide and suicidal thoughts are the result of psychiatric illnesses such as depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia; but can also occur after a major life stress event such as loss of a loved one or job. Suicide is often an impulsive act and can be prevented if intervention occurs. Suicide rates increase with age and are highest in patients greater than 75 years old. Women attempt suicide more often but men commit suicide much more frequently.","785":"Bleeding in the muscle and tissues behind the abdominal wall cavity. The bleeding can occur spontaneously in patients with a bleeding disorder (cirrhosis, hemophilia), in those taking anticoagulants (warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel), after a medical procedure, or after trauma. At times it occurs spontaneously and no reason is discovered. The bleeding can be severe and result in death.","786":"Stress headaches, also called tension headaches, are very common with most adults periodically experiencing this type of headache. They most commonly produce pain diffusely over the head and the back of the neck. They are often associated with tight neck muscles that pull against the scalp (apply \"tension,\" as in \"tension headache\u201d). Tensing of muscles can be a reaction to stress, which is one reason this headache has been named \"stress headache.\" Tension headaches are considered chronic when they occur at least twice a week for several months.","787":"A strain is a stretched or torn muscle. Any muscle may be involved. For a short time the injured muscle will have decreased strength or function. Bleeding into the tissue can occur causing bruising. Sometimes a strain (muscle injury) can be difficult to tell apart from a sprain (a sprain is an over-stretched or torn ligament.)","788":"The esophagus is the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. Foreign bodies in the esophagus occur when food or swallowed objects become lodged in the esophagus preventing food or liquids from passing. The most common risk factors are congenital webs, strictures, inflammation from gastroesophageal reflux, and cancer.","789":"A stab wound to the foot. These wounds can damage structures deep to the skin such as blood vessels, nerves, or tendons. The object that caused the wound can carry bacteria or foreign material deep into the wound and cause infections. Puncture wounds from animal or human bites are especially prone to infections. Punctures that penetrate through a shoe then into the foot are especially prone to infection, and can lead to a chronic bone infection.","79":"A breast cyst is a fluid-filled sac within the breast. Cysts are round or oval and can be painless or intermittently painful. They are usually found on a diagnostic image such as ultrasound or mammogram or on a manual breast exam.  Hormonal fluctuation and function, as well as age and medications, influence the development of breast cysts.  Breast cysts most commonly occur between the ages of 35 and 50.  Simple cysts are rarely cancerous.","790":"An inherited disorder characterized by intermittently low potassium levels in the blood and muscle weakness. The symptoms come and go and the disease usually manifests itself during the teenage years. The episodes last hours to a day. This disorder is rare and is an autosomal dominant disorder meaning that even if only one parent gives the affected gene to a person the person will have the disease. ","791":"A collection of pus in the anal or rectal region. Most common between ages 20 and 40. Men are affected more often than women. The most common cause is a blocked anal gland that becomes infected with bacteria.","792":"A hemangioma is a birthmark that consists of an abnormal collection of blood vessels in the skin. It typically grows during the first year of life then shrinks in size and is often not noticeable by year 10. These skin markings are usually benign and are not associated with any other medical conditions. ","793":"A rapid enlargement of the large intestine (colon) caused by inflammation of the colon (colitis). All of the colon or only a portion can be involved. The cause of the colitis can be inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis, infection, decreased blood supply (ischemia), or radiation. The disease can be very serious with 4-5% of affected patients dying. Patients are generally sick as well with fever and rapid heart rate.","794":"A tunnel is formed by the fascia along the side of the ankle. The tibial nerve passes through this tunnel along with tendons and the posterior tibial artery. The nerve can become compressed in this tunnel causing pain, numbness, and tingling. It is similar to carpal tunnel syndrome found in the wrist. The symptoms can appear after overuse or after an injury such as a sprain. ","795":"A viral infection that causes vomiting and diarrhea. It usually requires 24-48 hours for symptoms to occur after being infected with the virus (incubation period). The virus can be very contagious spreading through entire dorms or cruise ships. It generally resolves on its own, but can cause severe dehydration in the very young, very old and in those with already existing chronic diseases.","796":"A viral infection that is acquired from the bite of an infected mosquito. It is caused by the yellow fever virus, a flavivirus. Currently, it occurs most frequently in Africa and parts of South America. It is seen in the U.S. in people traveling to those areas. In mild cases, it causes fever, headache, nausea and vomiting. Yellow fever can become more serious, causing bleeding (hemorrhaging), heart, liver and kidney problems. Elevation of bilirubin in the blood causes jaundice and turns the skin yellow giving the disorder its name. Half of those with the severest form do not survive. Vaccination provides immunity and is recommended to all travelers visiting endemic areas.","797":"Difficult, uncomfortable, or infrequent bowel movements. The feces is typically hard and dry. Constipation is usually harmless, but it can indicate an underlying disorder. When severe, constipation can lead to fecal impaction; and if not relieved can result in intestinal obstruction. The primary causes of constipation include dehydration, sedentary lifestyle, medications (especially narcotics), stress, pregnancy, laxative abuse, depression, a diet that is low in fiber, and low thyroid levels.","798":"An infection caused by a type of fungus that belongs to the group called Mucorales. The most common species is Rhizopus. The disease most often affects patients with weakened immune systems. The infection is also seen with complications of diabetes such as diabetic ketoacidosis. The face and sinuses are usually affected, although the lungs, skin and intestines can be involved. The infection can spread from the sinuses to the brain and result in death. ","799":"Often referred to as \"tongue tie,\" ankyloglossia occurs when the fold of tissue that connects the tongue to the floor of the mouth (called the frenum) is too thick or short or has grown in a way that restricts the tongue. Most cases are mild, but some make it hard to speak or eat.","8":"The lack of ability to control bowel movements causing stool (feces) to pass unexpectedly from the rectum. It is also called bowel incontinence. This disorder can range from occasional leakage of stool while passing gas to a complete loss of bowel control. The following conditions are associated with bowel incontinence: spinal cord injury (cauda equina syndrome); laxative abuse; previous rectal surgery; rectal damage during childbirth; rectal damage after radiation treatment or after extensive pelvic surgery; fecal impaction; some mental health problems.","80":"A sudden interruption of blood flow to a portion of the brain causing injury. Some strokes are associated with bleeding into the damaged area. Most strokes are caused by a blocked artery in the brain from hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) or from a blood clot that travels from another area (embolus). The symptoms experienced depend on the artery blocked. Survival and the best outcome depend on seeking medical care immediately. Also known as a stroke.","800":"A psychiatric disorder characterized by feelings of emptiness, poor self-image, unstable relationships and impulsive behavior. Symptoms usually begin by early adulthood. People with this disorder often have a mood disorder, eating disorder or substance abuse problem as well. The disorder is diagnosed three times more often in women than men.","801":"Cocaine is a commonly abused drug because of its euphoric effects and addictive properties. The drug stimulates the brain and heart and if too much is used serious side effects can occur such as an irregular heart rate (arrhythmia), stroke, seizure and death. Drinking alcohol while taking cocaine can increase the chance of death. There are multiple forms of cocaine and it can be injected into a vein, inhaled through the nose or smoked. ","802":"A type of cancer that occurs in the bladder. The bladder is the organ in the pelvis that stores urine. Bladder cancer arises from abnormal growth of cells that line the bladder. This disorder is more common in older patients and in males, especially those who have been smokers. Luckily most of these cancers are caught before they spread (metastasize). But bladder cancer tends to recur, requiring retesting of a patient throughout their life.","803":"Genital warts are caused by the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection. There are many HPV types that can infect the genital areas of males and females, and some can also infect the mouth and throat. HPV that causes genital warts is acquired during sexual contact with an infected person. HPV can be transmitted even when an infected person has no signs or symptoms of the virus. It can sometimes take years to develop symptoms after being infected. Unfortunately most people do not know they are infected with the virus since the initial symptoms can be minor. In 90% of people the virus is cleared from the body without any treatment. Some types of HPV can cause genital warts and rarely warts in the throat. Other HPV types can cause cervical cancer, cancer of the anus, and cancer of the throat. The HPV vaccine decreases the risk of becoming infected with the HPV strains most likely to causes warts and cancer.  ","804":"A rare disorder that causes weakness of the eye muscles followed by weakness and incoordination of the arms and legs. It is felt to be a variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome. Like that syndrome, it tends to occur after a viral infection. This disorder can be very serious and lead to weakness of the breathing muscles and death. This disease is felt to be caused by an abnormal production of antibodies. Most patients with this disorder will recover with treatment but total recovery can take as long as 6 months.","805":"An abnormal connection established between the bladder and the vagina. Patients typically have urinary incontinence. The most common causes are trauma during childbirth, gynecologic surgery, vaginal radiation therapy, or invasive cancer of the cervix.","806":"A weakening of the abdominal wall in the area of the belly button (umbilicus) that allows abdominal contents to protrude through the defect. If the intestines poke through the defect they can become pinched. This can cut off the blood supply to the part of the intestine that is pinched, and that can lead to a life threatening condition. Umbilical hernias that are present at birth will typically go away without treatment and will be watched by the doctor.","807":"Diastema is a gap or space between two teeth. It appears most often between the two upper front teeth. However, it can occur between any two teeth. Common causes include having teeth that vary in size, a size mismatch between the teeth and the jawbones, thumb sucking, gum disease, or a smaller and thicker than normal amount of tissue between the two front teeth. In children, a gap between teeth usually is part of normal development. Most of the time, the space closes by itself when permanent teeth come in.","808":"The brain communicates with the spinal cord. The spinal cord transmits signals to the body through the peripheral nerves. The nerves may be severed partially or completely. Recovery, even if the nerve is sutured back together is unpredictable.","809":"Trigger finger is a condition that results in painful popping or snapping of the finger when it is bent and straightened. The finger can also become locked in a bent position. Normally, the tendons in the finger glide smoothly through a tube called a tendon sheath. In patients with a trigger finger, the tendon becomes irritated and inflamed, causing decreased mobility through the tendon sheath. Trigger finger is one of the most common causes of hand pain and disability. Trigger finger most commonly affects the thumb.","81":"Any allergic reaction or symptom that is caused by a medication. The reactions can be mild such as nausea. They can be life threatening such anaphylaxis: low blood pressure, fainting and collapse. Small children and the elderly are most susceptible to medication reactions. A medication reaction should be considered as a possible cause for a sudden change in behavior or new symptom in children and the elderly. Over the counter medications can also cause serious side effects. Even medications that initially were tolerated without a problem can result in serious reactions. Some medication reactions are caused by taking too much of the drug requiring a decrease in a patient's dose. For specific reactions review the adverse reaction section of the medication being taken.","810":"A Meckel's diverticulum is a pouch that develops in the lower portion of the small intestine (ileum). It is present at birth and can contain stomach or pancreatic tissue. This diverticulum may become inflamed and infected, can cause intestinal blockage, and cause intestinal bleeding. An inflamed diverticulum is called diverticulitis. Up to 2% of people have a Meckel's diverticulum, but most never have any symptoms. ","811":"A fracture is a break in a bone. The ankle is a complex joint containing the tibia and fibula of the lower leg and the talus bone of the foot. Strong ligaments keep the ankle bones in place. Simple fractures can be treated just with a walking boot. Complex fractures tear ligaments and cause distortion of the ankle joint. These complex fractures typically require surgery. If the skin is broken (as in an open or compound fracture) surgery and antibiotics typically are required.","812":"Neuralgia is a term that refers to pain caused by irritation or damage to a nerve. It is often described as sharp and burning and can be very severe. The pain is usually in the area of the skin supplied by the nerve and the symptoms can become worse with simply touching the area of skin involved. Common neuralgias are trigeminal neuralgia, neuralgia from shingles and radiating nerve pain from the lumbar or cervical spine.","813":"The bacteria that is responsible for \"strep throat\" is Streptococcus Group A. It can also cause a crusting red skin infection called impetigo. It generally causes a mild infection, but can enter the blood stream and result in life threatening infections (necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome). Untreated or partially treated streptococcal throat infections can cause rheumatic fever. Occasionally kidney failure can occur after a streptococcal throat infection.","814":"A benign inflammatory process in the breast that can look like breast cancer on physical exam, also on a mammogram and ultrasound. Usually a biopsy  is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Breast fat necrosis is most common after surgery, radiation therapy or breast trauma.","815":"A cancerous growth of cells in the kidney. In adults renal cell carcinoma is the most common form of kidney cancer and arises from the renal tubule. Surgery is the primary mode of therapy. Renal cell carcinoma is usually resistant to radiation therapy and chemotherapy, but it may respond to immunotherapy. The following conditions increase the risk of this disorder: family history of kidney cancer, high blood pressure, smoking, obesity, male gender, and receiving dialysis treatments. Among children, a common form of kidney cancer is called a Wilms' tumor.\r\n","816":"Essential thrombocythemia is an abnormally high production of cells called megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. The bone marrow is the soft spongy material contained in the center of the bones. These cells are responsible for producing platelets. Platelets are blood products that help the blood clot. In essential thrombocythemia, platelet levels are excessive (greater than 600,000 per microliter) and can lead to clotting problems. ","817":"A persistent incapacitating weakness or fatigue, accompanied by a set of symptoms, lasting at least 6 months, and not attributable to any known cause. While the exact cause of CFS is unknown, one theory suggests that it may develop when a person's immune system reacts abnormally to a viral infection. Other factors such as age, prior illness, stress, environment, or genetics may also play a role. CFS more commonly occurs in women ages 30 to 50.","818":"A liver disease that persists over a long period of time, potentially resulting in a progressive destruction of the liver. In the end stages patients may have problems clotting their blood, and can become confused. There are many causes with longstanding alcohol abuse and viral infections being the most common. ","819":"A temperature above 101.5 F (38.3 C) on at least four occasions over a 14 day period without explanation. Most people with fevers of unknown origin are eventually diagnosed with infections, cancers or an autoimmune disease. ","82":"Severe constipation with a large amount of fecal material stuck in the rectum. This disorder is usually not serious, but can be quite uncomfortable and may complicate other illnesses. Risk factors include narcotic use or other medicines that slow bowel function, a low fiber diet, a sedentary lifestyle or diseases that affect the nerve supply of the intestines.","820":"An accumulation of fluid between the lung and its surroundings (the chest wall and diaphragm). If a pleural effusion is large (a large collection of fluid), the lung may become compressed. This can lead to difficulties breathing and pain. There are multiple causes including: heart failure, infections, cancer in the lung or surrounding the lung, renal failure, and autoimmune diseases.","821":"A benign tumor is an abnormal growth of cells that are not cancerous. The cells of a benign tumor do not metastasize (extend beyond the outer surface of the tumor). They can be found in almost all parts of the body. Moles and lipomas (fatty tumors) are common examples of benign tumors.","822":"A mass of tissue which develops in the middle ear or in the eardrum. It usually occurs in situations where the eustachian tube is blocked. Negative pressure in the middle ear creates a sac or cyst that fills with old skin cells and other waste material. The cyst may become infected, and may get bigger breaking down some of the middle ear bones, affecting hearing.","823":"A blood clot embedded in one of the major deep veins of the legs, arms or pelvis. The clot blocks blood flow through these veins preventing blood from being brought back to the heart. Smoking, certain inherited (genetic) conditions (including factor V Leiden mutation, protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, and antithrombin III deficiency), birth control pills, prolonged sitting, cancer,  prolonged bed rest, pregnancy,  intravenous catheters, and recent fractures increase the risk of DVT. If the blood clot breaks away it can travel through the heart and lodge in the pulmonary artery causing a life threatening disease called pulmonary embolus.","824":"A skin rash caused by a skin infection with nematodes parasites (roundworms). Cutaneous larva migrans is also called creeping eruption. The skin rash and symptoms are caused by the inflammatory reaction to the parasite. Risk factors for infection include sunbathing or walking barefoot in a tropical location or a hobby or occupation requiring contact with warm, sandy soil. ","825":"Testicular hypofunction occurs when the testicles produce less than normal amounts of testosterone. Hypofunction may be caused by a problem that is related to the testes themselves (primary hypofunction) or by low production of luteinizing hormone (LH) by the pituitary gland (secondary hypofunction). LH is released into the blood stream and signals the testes to make testosterone.","826":"Warfarin inhibits vitamin K dependent coagulation factors. It is used to thin the blood in patients who have had deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism or have a high risk of forming blood clots in the heart secondary to atrial fibrillation or mechanical heart valve replacement. Almost all overdoses occur because of errors in dosing and\/or drug-drug interactions. The overdose may cause no symptoms and only be recognized on a blood test that demonstrates a high Prothrombin Time (PT) or high INR (International Normalized Ratio). However, overdoses can lead to life threatening bleeding.","827":"Black stools can be the result of ingesting bismuth usually in the form of bismuth subsalicylate commonly known as \"pink bismuth\". Pink bismuth is the active ingredient in Pepto-Bismol and Kaopectate. Taking iron pills can also cause black stools. So can bleeding in the stomach or small intestine.","828":"An inflammation of the brain usually from a viral infection. Viral encephalitis may be caused by herpes simplex, varicella, west Nile virus, measles, chickenpox, rubella, and equine viruses. Rarely encephalitis can result from cancer, bacterial, fungal or parasitic infections, from medications or a reaction to a vaccination.","829":"Medial epicondylitis is similar to tennis elbow, but it occurs on the inside rather than the outside of the elbow. Also known as golfer's elbow, but It is not limited to golfers. Anyone who repeatedly uses their wrists and hands can develop the disorder. The pain comes from inflammation of the medial epicondyle and the tendons attaching there. The medial epicondyle is the bony protrusion on the inside portion of the elbow that arises from the upper arm bone (humerus).","83":"A fracture is a break in a bone. The foot has 26 bones and a fracture causes pain and swelling. Sometimes a fracture cannot be seen with a standard x-ray and a CT scan may need to done. If the broken bone punctures through the skin it is called an open or compound fracture. Open fractures can become infected and result in loss of function and even loss of the foot. ","830":"Klebsiella are bacteria that can cause a variety of infections. Common Klebsiella infections include community-acquired pneumonia, urinary tract infections and chronic infections of the nose. At times these bacteria can invade the blood stream and cause a life threatening condition called sepsis.","831":"Duodenal cancer is the growth of abnormal cells in a portion of the small intestine near the stomach. These abnormal cells ultimately grow and produce a tumor. This cancer is relatively rare compared to stomach and colorectal cancer. ","832":"Refers to a superficial tear in the lower part of the esophagus that occurs during forceful vomiting, prolonged vomiting, or persistent coughing. These tears may cause severe bleeding. Any disorder that causes vigorous vomiting or coughing can cause this disorder. ","833":"Lip swelling can result from trauma, an allergic reaction, inflammation, infection, cancer or a medication reaction. The most common type of medication that causes lip swelling is a blood pressure medication called an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (such as lisinopril, captopril, enalapril, and ramipril).","834":"A chronic disease of metabolism distinguished by the body\u2019s inability to produce enough insulin and\/or a resistance to the insulin being made. Insulin is necessary for body cells to transport sugar into the cells and to process carbohydrates, fat, and protein efficiently. Patients with diabetes have too much glucose in their circulation causing damage to almost every organ in their body. There are multiple types of diabetes. The most common are: Type 1 is usually found in younger patients and requires insulin, Type 2 usually develops later in life and is  commonly associated with obesity, and gestational diabetes is associated with pregnancy.","835":"A blood clot in the cavernous sinus. The cavernous sinus is one of the venous channels draining blood away from the brain. The carotid artery and cranial nerves pass through this sinus. The cavernous sinus is located at the base of the skull, behind the eyes. A blood clot in this sinus is called cavernous sinus thrombosis. The cause of cavernous sinus thrombosis is usually a bacterial infection that has spread from the sinuses, ears, eyes, nose, or skin of the face.","836":"A condition in which one or more parts of the wall of the large intestine bulges out like a balloon. The multiple bulges are called diverticula. The complications of diverticulosis include infection (diverticulitis) and bleeding. The disorder is more common with advancing age: over 50% of patients older than 60 have diverticula. Other risk factors for acquiring diverticulosis include constipation or a diet that is low in dietary fiber content. Many patients have diverticulosis without having any symptoms.","837":"A stage of a woman's life where the ovaries do not produce enough estrogen to maintain normal menstrual cycles. It often begins with irregular menstrual cycles. Menopause officially starts 12 months after the last menstrual period. It occurs most commonly between 45 and 55 years of age. Declining levels of estrogen cause many of the symptoms. ","838":"Leukoplakia is a white or gray-white patch in the mouth that cannot be wiped off. The patches usually develop slowly, over weeks or months. They are usually caused by irritation. They are rarely cancerous. Leukoplakia is more common in people who are exposed to chewing tobacco, cigarette smoke, sun on the lips, or certain mouthwashes or toothpastes that contain sanguinarine. It also is seen in people who have ill-fitting dentures or rough surfaces on teeth, fillings, or crowns.","839":"Influenza is a highly contagious viral respiratory infection, and is spread by respiratory droplets that are released into the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Infected persons can spread the flu to others up to 6 feet away. The flu has an incubation period of 24 to 48 hours after exposure. There are three main types of influenza (A, B, C). Type A is most able to change its structure from year to year, giving it the ability to produce widespread outbreaks. Because Type A so frequently changes its structure, a new type of vaccine is required each year to protect against the strains of the virus that are circulating that year. The disease is usually self-limited (resolves without treatment), but can be fatal in the very young, very old, or if there is a coexisting depression of the immune system. It sometimes can be difficult to tell the difference between a cold and the flu based on symptoms alone. In general the flu is worse than the common cold and symptoms such as fever (usually over 101F) and body aches are more severe with the flu. For more information: http:\/\/www.flu.gov","84":"Knee swelling can result from a number of conditions, including: degenerative joint disease, trauma, infection, gout, pseudogout, or an autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis.","840":"Bruxism is the clenching or grinding of teeth. Most people are not even aware that they are doing this. In the United States, bruxism affects about 30 million to 40 million people. Some people grind their teeth only during sleep. Others grind or clench their teeth during the day as well. The rate is highest in children under age 11. The underlying cause of bruxism varies. Causes can include stress, habit or poor alignment of teeth.","841":"Cut on the skin overlying the knee. Lacerations of the knee can be simple involving only the skin or complex with injury to tendons, nerves, blood vessels or the joint. With tendon lacerations there is weakness in the leg movement, and with nerve damage numbness is experienced beyond the laceration. Deep lacerations that invade the joint space can be serious since they can lead to an infection in the joint.","842":"Inflammation of the mucus membranes of the nose and upper respiratory tract can occur in response to an irritant. In allergic rhinitis, the hypersensitive response of the immune system occurs in response to airborne allergens. This is a common disorder, affecting at least a quarter of the population. ","843":"Any object not intended to be placed in the vaginal cavity. These can be placed accidentally or intentionally. If not removed they can cause infection and erosion of the vaginal wall.","844":"An eating disorder associated with an abnormal perception of body image. Patients may eat large amounts of food then purge through self-induced vomiting or with the use of laxatives. This disorder may be associated with anorexia nervosa. Patients with this disorder can suffer from depression and other psychiatric problems. ","845":"Too much glucose in the circulation causing damage to almost every organ in the body. Diabetes mellitus type 2 is more often seen in adults and is more common in patients who are overweight. Early in the disease, patients usually have high or normal levels of insulin but have insulin resistance. Over time the pancreas will make less insulin. It is rare for type 2 diabetes to develop diabetic ketoacidosis.","846":"An alteration in thinking, behavior and\/or consciousness caused by the consumption of alcohol (ethanol). Can result in impulsive and uninhibited behavior. Alcohol affects people differently. The same amount can have only minimal effects on one person and severely depress the breathing of another.","847":"Pediatric head trauma occurs when a child bumps their head. Usually, the trauma is minimal and only results in mild symptoms such as a bruise or headache. In other cases, the child may experience symptoms of a concussion such as a loss of consciousness, vomiting or confusion. Concussions usually resolve over a short period of time and are rarely the cause of long term problems. However, if a child experiences multiple concussions, they are at risk for more serious brain damage. In cases of severe head trauma, there may be bleeding in the brain or a skull fracture. ","848":"The most common cause of lumbar spinal stenosis is degenerative arthritis. As one ages the bones, the discs between the bones of the spine and the ligaments that connect these bones can begin to wear out. This results in loss of cartilage, extra bone formation (osteophytes), and loss of height of the discs. These processes cause a reduction in the normal spaces for the nerves to travel resulting in compression of the nerves and the symptoms of pain, weakness and numbness. Other causes include bone diseases such as Paget's, tumors and injury.","849":"A disorder where the bones become weak, making it easier for them to break. Fractures can occur with even mild stress such as sitting down too hard, coughing, or bending over. The most common areas of fracture are in the back (spine), wrist and hip. Anyone can develop osteoporosis, but it is more common in older women. The body constantly makes new bone and breaks down old bone. In a person with osteoporosis, more bone gets broken down than gets made, causing a loss of bone mass with advancing age. Other conditions can worsen this disorder including: poor nutrition, smoking, being thin, chemotherapy, radiation treatment, medications such as corticosteroids (prednisone), decreased physical activity, alcohol consumption, being of Caucasian ancestry, and drinking cola drinks. Osteoporosis runs in families.","85":"An inflammation of the small passages in the lungs (bronchioles), usually caused by a viral infection. The most common viruses are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza. The disease usually affects children under the age of 2, with a peak age of 3 to 6 months. ","850":"Mastoiditis is the inflammation of air cells in the temporal bone (bone that contains the inner\/middle ear). Mastoiditis is associated with middle ear infections (otitis media). The infection of the middle ear can extend into the air cells of the mastoid and result in bone infection and bone destruction. Streptococcus bacteria are the most common bacteria causing mastoiditis. Mastoiditis is a disease of young people although it can occur at any age.","851":"Small cell lung cancer is a fast growing cancer and is more aggressive than non-small cell lung cancer, the other major type of lung cancer. Most cases of this cancer occur in cigarette smokers. This cancer used to have a very poor prognosis but newer treatments have improved average survival. ","852":"The virus most often associated with the common cold. The virus causes an infection of the upper respiratory tract (nose and throat). It is very contagious and spreads through the air or by direct contact with an infected person. The disease resolves on its own.","853":"An abnormal growth of cells in the stomach. The most common type of cancer comes from the cells that produce mucous in the stomach and is called adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma of the stomach is more common in some countries (such as Japan) than in the United States. Other types of stomach cancer include lymphoma, carcinoid tumor, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). A diet low in fruits and vegetables, family history of stomach cancer, pernicious anemia, Helicobacter pylori infection,  smoking, and gastric polyps increase the risk of acquiring this cancer. These cancers can be very serious and a patient's ability to survive this disorder depends on the type of cancer and the size and spread of the tumor when it is discovered.","854":"Papillae are tiny bumps of tissue on your tongue. Many of them contain tastebuds. Sometimes they can become painful. Trauma, such as biting your tongue or eating something hot or very spicy, and cigarette or cigar smoking are the most common causes of painful papillae of the tongue. A painful tongue also can be a symptom of other health conditions, such as vitamin deficiency or infections.","855":"Nabothian cysts are mucus-filled cysts on the surface of the cervix. They are a normal finding but are more common in women who have had children and those that are post-menopausal. Occasionally, they are related to chronic infections of the cervix.","856":"Hirsutism is the excessive growth of hair on a woman's face and body. The hair is coarse and colored and resembles a male pattern of hair growth. Hair growth can be stimulated by the excessive production of male sex hormones called androgens. Also, certain medications such as progestins (a type of birth control pill) and those used to treat nausea, bipolar disorder, seizures, high blood pressure and migraine headaches can cause the abnormal hair growth. Certain medical conditions of the ovaries (polycystic ovarian disease), adrenal and pituitary glands cause abnormal production of androgens.","857":"People suffering from nyctalopia (night blindness) cannot see in dim or dark lighting. Night blindness can be caused by a vitamin A or zinc deficiency, or a more serious condition called retinitis pigmentosa. Other possible causes of night blindness include cataracts, some glaucoma medications and diabetic retinopathy.","858":"Elevated blood pressure after the 20th week of pregnancy. It occurs in 6-7% of all pregnancies, and is most commonly seen with the woman's first pregnancy. If severe and untreated it can cause damage to the kidneys, heart, and brain. The disorder can also lead to pre-eclampsia, a serious complication of pregnancy that may lead to seizures, bleeding, and other problems. Women with gestational hypertension also have a higher incidence of having premature deliveries and low birth weight babies.","859":"A non-cancerous growth on the white part of the eye (conjunctiva). The growth is white to yellow and generally does not cause any problems. It usually arises on the nasal side of the eye.","86":"Abnormal fluid pocket that forms in an ovary. Before it releases an egg during a menstrual cycle, the ovary forms the beginning of a cyst by surrounding an egg with fluid. The most common type of ovarian cyst is made by this process--it is simply an overly large fluid pocket around an egg that does not easily leave the ovary. This is called a \"functional cyst\". Other kinds of ovary cysts are endometriomas, cystadenomas, dermoid cysts, and polycystic ovaries.","860":"Persistent pain in the jaw joint and\/or headaches related to a problem in one or both temporomandibular joints (TMJ). The TMJ connects the jaw to the skull, and is composed of cartilage, muscles and ligaments. There are multiple causes including: grinding of teeth, trauma, inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, and malocclusion of the teeth. Sometimes no direct cause is discovered. The disease is diagnosed more commonly in women and adults in the 20-40 age range.","861":"Lead poisoning most commonly occurs over time. The ingested amount of lead is not cleared from the body and accumulates. The lead causes anemia, decreased IQ, abdominal pain, constipation, and kidney damage. Children are more susceptible, and exposure is often from old peeling paint or old water pipes containing lead. Other types of exposure are from hobbies and toys. In adults, exposure may occur among those who hunt with lead bullets or use them regularly at a firing range.","862":"Enlarged lymph nodes near the neck. The enlarged lymph nodes can result from infection, tumor or inflammation.","863":"Irregular bleeding from the uterus that is not the result of an identifiable medical illness or structural abnormality of the uterus, such as a fibroid tumor. A hormone imbalance is the most common cause. A failure to ovulate is commonly associated with dysfunctional uterine bleeding.","864":"An autoimmune disease that causes hair loss. Cells from the body's own immune system, which are supposed to attack only foreign invaders, attack normal tissue (hair follicles) of the body. Besides hair loss most patients do not experience any other symptoms. 14% of patients experience burning and itching in the area of hair loss. The progression of the hair loss can be unpredictable and most patients have only one patch of hair loss. The scalp is the most commonly affected area. Two subtypes exist: alopecia totalis occurs when all the scalp hair is lost; and alopecia universalis occurs with complete loss of all body hair. The exact cause of the disorder is unknown, but the disease does run in families. ","865":"Beta blocker medications block the beta receptors and are used to treat several conditions, including heart disease and hypertension. Overdoses can be accidental or intentional and can be lethal if untreated. Common beta blocker medications include atenolol (Tenormin), sotalol (Betapace), carvedilol (Coreg), metoprolol (Lopressor), and propranolol (Inderal). Overdoses of these drugs are usually accidental in children and intentional in adults. ","866":"Hepatitis A is a viral infection that damages the liver. Most cases of hepatitis A are mild and go away after a few weeks. The virus is usually acquired by eating or drinking contaminated food or water, and can also be acquired through sexual contact with an infected person. Transmission through contaminated food or water is more common in areas with poor sanitary conditions. An immunization (vaccine) is available against hepatitis A.","867":"A sudden stoppage of blood flow to one of the small arteries of a deep area of the brain causing injury. These strokes are usually located in areas of the brain called the pons and basal ganglia. They are most likely to occur in older people, especially those with  high blood pressure (hypertension). Unlike other strokes, these strokes are rarely caused by an embolism (a clot that travels through the bloodstream). The symptoms experienced depend on the area of the brain that is affected. ","868":"Babies generally get their first teeth between 3 and 7 months. Experts disagree whether the appearance of teeth actually causes symptoms. Most healthcare providers believe babies who are teething experience drooling, mild gum swelling, and fussiness. Most pediatricians do not think teething causes fever or diarrhea. ","869":"A group of disorders that affects many functions of the brain including movement, vision, sensation, thinking ability, and speech. Cerebral palsy (CP) is usually caused by injury to the brain while the baby is in the womb or during childbirth. There is no cure for CP. There are many types of CP including spastic, dyskinetic, ataxic, hypotonic, and mixed.","87":"Rupture of the eardrum (tympanic membrane). This membrane vibrates when sound waves enter the ear and is crucial to normal hearing. This membrane also separates the middle ear from the ear canal. Infection in the middle ear (otitis media) can cause a rupture of the membrane. The membrane can also be damaged from trauma or a foreign body being inserted into the ear.","870":"Systemic sclerosis (also called scleroderma) is a rare disease in which scar tissue deposits in the skin and many internal organs. Scleroderma can affect only the skin or involve other parts of the body. This disorder is thought to be an autoimmune disease.  This means the immune system mistakenly attacks certain organs of the body. The disease can be serious leading not only to scarring of the skin but also to damage of the esophagus, heart, lungs and kidneys. Scleroderma is most frequently diagnosed in people between the ages of 30 and 50 and is more common among women.","871":"A bacterial infection that can involve any part of the body, but most commonly affects the skin and soft tissue (cellulitis) or causes a collection of pus (abscess). Staph bacteria are commonly found on the skin and in the nose but does not always cause an infection. These people are colonized but do not actually become ill. The infection can be localized to the skin or become widespread and lethal. The infection more commonly occurs in those with weakened immune systems, burns, surgical wounds, and patients with invasive devices such as urinary catheters, intravenous catheters, dialysis catheters, or breathing tubes. Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a special type of staphylococcus that can be harder to treat, requiring special antibiotics.","872":"A bruise (hematoma) that develops under the fingernail after trauma to the finger. Bruises develop when small blood vessels under the nail tear or rupture. Blood leaks into tissues under the nail and causes the black-and-blue color. The blood becomes trapped under the nail and with time causes increasing pain and pressure.","873":"Retinitis pigmentosa is the slow breakdown of cells in the retina (light-sensitive layer of the eye) that are responsible for sensing light. The disorder is thought to be inherited. Over time, individuals will experience visual loss and possibly blindness. Retinitis pigmentosa is one of the leading causes of blindness in the United States. Approximately 100,000 people are thought to have the disease.","874":"An infection of the joint, usually caused by bacteria. The bacteria can enter the joint by traveling through the blood or by direct entrance into the joint from trauma. The infection can cause permanent destruction of the joint if left untreated or can spread to the bloodstream and can be life-threatening. Previous joint surgery, injection drug use, and a depressed immune system increase the risk of the disorder.","875":"Causes low blood glucose levels and if severe can result in seizures, coma, stroke and death. The overdose can occur by accident through a medication error, or by purposeful injection. Insulin overdose can also occur if the normal dose is taken and the patient doesn't eat enough calories for the dose injected or if the normal dose lasts longer than usual (as may occur with kidney failure). Insulin overdose and a low blood sugar should always be considered when a person with diabetes feels unwell or is not acting normally.","876":"Inflammation in a joint caused by uric acid crystals getting into the joint fluid. This happens more often in people with high blood uric acid levels due to an imbalance between the production and excretion of uric acid. The attacks are usually recurrent and most commonly affect the great toe, foot, ankle, knee, and hand. The pain can be severe, increasing with even the slightest touch of the affected joint.","877":"A type of arthritis that affects the sacroiliac joint and spine. Symptoms include pain and stiffness that often starts in the low back. It can progressively affect the entire spine from the neck down. The spine's bones (vertebrae) may fuse together, resulting in a rigid spine. These changes may be mild or severe. Ankylosing spondylitis can also cause pain and stiffness in other joints, such as the hips and knees. The disorder is more common in males in the 20 to 40 year age range.","878":"A cut on the finger. Lacerations of the finger can be simple, involving only the skin, or complex with injury to tendons, nerves and\/or blood vessels. With tendon lacerations there is weakness of the finger, and with nerve damage numbness is experienced beyond the laceration.","879":"Damage or death of heart muscle caused by a blockage of an artery (coronary artery) that supplies blood to a part of the heart. Symptoms can vary widely and can be atypical in the elderly, diabetics and women. The most common cause of the blockage is buildup of fat and calcium in the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle (atherosclerosis). Conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, family history of heart attacks and diabetes can all increase the chances of having a heart attack. Rapid treatment reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of death. Longer term consequences of having had a heart attack include heart failure and stroke.","88":"Narcotic abuse can involve illegal opiates such as heroin or from the abuse of prescription medications such as opiates (pain medication: hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine). Overuse of prescription pain medications can often be referred to \"prescription medication abuse\".  Taking narcotics for an extended period of time may lead to tolerance and increased doses to alleviate pain. Abruptly stopping the medication will cause withdrawal symptoms-this is narcotic dependence. Addiction is elevated narcotic abuse that becomes compulsive and self-destructive. Complications of intravenous narcotic abuse include infections such as HIV, hepatitis and organ failure. Abuse of any narcotic can lead to loss of job and alienation from loved ones.","880":"The esophagus is the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. An esophageal rupture occurs when there is a tear in the esophagus. Cancer, ingesting corrosive fluids, forceful vomiting, and trauma can all cause a rupture. The esophagus can also be damaged during an endoscopy. Leakage of food or fluid into the chest through the ruptured area can lead to serious irritation, infection and death.","881":"Osteoarthritis of the neck. This arthritis usually occurs because of the age-related degenerative disease that develops in the neck joints and disks. All patients experience some wear and tear of the neck joints as they age but some have more severe damage causing significant pain and loss of function. As the arthritis develops there can be the development of bone spurs, or osteophytes. These bone spurs can irritate the nearby nerves, ligaments and muscles causing pain. Spondylosis is one of the most common causes of pain in the elderly.","882":"Inflammation of the dental pulp within the tooth caused by bacteria that enter the space through tooth decay. Tooth infections are also called pulpitis. The pulp contains the blood vessels, the nerves and connective tissue inside a tooth.","883":"A rare cause of stroke. The dural sinuses drain blood from the brain. A thrombosis or clot in this sinus causes the disorder. Patients experience headache and a variety of neurologic symptoms including confusion, weakness, seizures, slurred speech, and incoordination. At times patients have a pre-existing clotting disorder.","884":"Caused by a parasitic worm (Onchocerca volvulus) and is spread by the bite of an infected black fly. Infected persons may not have symptoms, but a skin rash, eye lesions and\/or bumps under the skin can occur. Eye lesions can progress to blindness. The disease is found in thirty African countries, Central America, and Yemen. ","885":"A human viral infection caused by the virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus. The first phase of infection is a flu-like illness with headache, fever and muscle aches. Most people recover without any other symptoms. About one-third of people will later develop complications including meningitis (inflammation of the membrane covering the brain), encephalitis (inflammation within the brain) and\/or myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord). Symptoms of this phase include a new headache, confusion and\/or numbness and weakness in the legs. Patients become infected with the virus during a tick bite. ","886":"Acetaminophen is primarily metabolized by the liver. Too much acetaminophen (Tylenol) can overwhelm the liver, thus producing toxic substances that can destroy the liver, resulting in death.","887":"Inflammation of the portion of the eye that contains the iris, the ciliary body and the choroid. This area is also called the anterior chamber. The cause can be autoimmune diseases or trauma. It is most commonly seen in people ages 20 to 50. It can be serious, leading to permanent vision loss. The primary causes are: autoimmune diseases (Rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis), inflammatory conditions (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), trauma, infections (toxoplasmosis, syphilis, tuberculosis), and cancer (lymphoma).","888":"Fainting while urinating or just after urinating. This problem usually occurs in older men and during the night when they wake up to urinate. This occurs because urinating stimulates the vagus nerve, which then causes a drop in blood pressure and a slow heart rate, resulting in fainting. Why urinating stimulates the nerve in some people but not others is unknown. Straining to urinate may increase the frequency of this disorder. Certain medications, alcohol and being dehydrated can increase the frequency of these events. It is recommended patients with this disorder see their doctor to make sure something more serious is not causing the fainting. It is believed micturition syncope causes 2%-8% of all cases of fainting in adults. Similar fainting episodes can occur with having a bowel movement as well. ","889":"Occurs when a carcinoid tumor produces serotonin in excess. Only 10% of carcinoid tumors cause this syndrome. The symptoms of carcinoid syndrome include abdominal pain, facial flushing, racing heart and other symptoms that can be caused by activity or certain foods. The carcinoid tumors grow slowly and typically involve the stomach, intestines or lungs. It is more common for large tumors and tumors not in the intestines to cause the syndrome since the blood supply from the intestines flows to the liver. The liver neutralizes the serotonin, which prevents the symptoms. Complications include heart disease, intestinal blockage and carcinoid crisis. Carcinoid crisis involves flushing, low blood pressure, confusion and breathing problems.","89":"An ulcer or erosion of the lining of the stomach. At times these ulcers can cause life-threatening bleeding. Rarely the ulcers are secondary to cancer. An infection with the bacteria Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) can increase the incidence and severity of the disease. The following conditions increase the risk of this disorder: drinking alcohol, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \/ NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin), smoking, and physical stress (infections, trauma, hospital admission). Rarely the ulcer can extend through the entire lining of the stomach (perforation) and result in a life threatening abdominal infection (peritonitis).","890":"Drug reactions can result in many different symptoms but rash, fatigue and gastrointestinal reactions are among the most common. In severe cases, the reactions can result in airway swelling and very low blood pressure, occasionally resulting in death.","891":"Cellular changes in the esophagus that can be precancerous. It occurs as a complication of chronic gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD occurs when acidic fluid leaks from the stomach into the esophagus (the swallowing tube), and is classically associated with heartburn. Barrett's is more common in men, and rarely can transform into cancer.","892":"An empyema is the accumulation of pus in a body cavity, though the term usually refers to pus within the chest. The pus develops between the lung and the chest cavity where it can impair lung function. The bacteria causing the accumulation can cause damage to the body as well.","893":"A swelling of the skin, eyes, lips, mouth, or tongue. The swelling occurs just below the skin. At times it can be very serious and block off the airway preventing a patient from breathing. The disorder can be part of an allergic reaction and be associated with hives. Some patients have a familial form (hereditary angioedema) that results from low levels of a protein called C1 inhibitors. A small group of patients will have a reaction to a type of blood pressure medications called ACE (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme) inhibitors manifested as angioedema of the lips, eyes, tongue or mouth. Common ACE inhibitors include: captopril (Capoten), lisinopril (Lisodur, Lopril, Novatec, Prinivil, Zestril), enalapril (Vasotec, Renitec), ramipril (Altace, Tritace, Ramace, Ramiwin), quinapril (Accupril), fosinopril (Monopril), and benazepril (Lotensin).","894":"A blood clot that forms in the vein that drains blood from the kidney. The most common cause is dehydration. Other causes include: a type of kidney disease called nephrotic syndrome, trauma to the abdomen or back, cancer, scar formation of the vein, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and blood clotting disorders. ","895":"A painful and persistent erection of the penis. It can occur without sexual arousal. It is a rare, but serious condition. It requires immediate treatment to prevent permanent injury and impotence. The most common causes are sickle cell anemia, self-injected medications used for erectile dysfunction, and more rarely other medications used for impotence such as sildenafil (Viagra) or sleep (Trazodone).","896":"A disease in which small blood vessels become inflamed (vasculitis) which causes purple spots on the skin (purpura). Other manifestations include: joint pain, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and inflammation of the kidneys (glomerulonephritis). It is more common in children than adults. The cause of the disease is unknown. It is characterized by an abnormal immune response. A serious intestinal disorder called intussusception can be associated with this disorder.","897":"Familial dysautonomia is an inherited disorder that affects the nervous system. People with this disorder are born with fewer nerve fibers to send signals throughout the body. They also have a lower level of a chemical called norepinephrine which is responsible for sending messages between nerves. As a result, these individuals have trouble with many important bodily functions such as digestion, urination and control of blood pressure. The disease occurs when a copy of the IKBKAP gene is passed from the mother and father to the child. The disease is most common in individuals who are Jewish from eastern European descent (Ashkenazi). It is estimated that 1 in 3600 of these individuals will have this disorder.","898":"The esophagus is the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. Esophageal cancer usually begins in the lower third of the esophagus, and occurs predominantly in adults over the age of 50. Esophageal cancer has often spread by the time it is diagnosed or soon after. It is more common in smokers, heavy alcohol drinkers and those with Barrett's esophagus.","899":"A blood clot which forms between the skull and the outermost lining of the brain or just outside the lining of the spinal cord. The outside lining is known as the dura. The bleeding often comes from an injured artery after a skull fracture or other trauma. The bleeding can occur rapidly leading to brain injury and death. Occasionally patients experience a lucid period where their initial symptoms improve before they become rapidly ill and unconscious. Epidural hematomas of the spine can happen after a traumatic injury or an epidural injection, especially if the patient is taking an anticoagulant drug (blood thinner).","9":"An abnormal collection of arteries and veins where the arteries connect directly to the veins without passing through the very small blood vessels called capillaries. Patients are usually born with this condition (congenital) and many times do not even know they have the disorder. Complications of an AVM include bleeding, pressing on normal tissue around the AVM, and preventing adequate blood supply to the certain parts of the body. These AVMs can be found anywhere in the body.","90":"A form of low blood pressure that happens when one stands up from sitting or lying down. Patients feel dizzy or lightheaded, and can faint with standing. It is more common in older adults and 15 % of those 65 and older have orthostatic hypotension. The disorder can be secondary to medications, heart disease, dehydration, bleeding, and neurologic disorders. Also called orthostatic hypotension.","900":"The loss of pigmentation in patches of the skin. It can affect persons of any race or ethnic group, and often occurs on the skin on the back of the hands, face and armpits. The loss of pigmentation is caused by the destruction of melanocytes that produce the pigment in the skin. Vitiligo is an autoimmune disorder that can be hereditary.","901":"Dysgeusia is an abnormal taste or change in taste that won't go away. It can be described as bad, metallic, salty, foul, or rancid. Some people with dysgeusia also have an altered sense of smell (dysosmia). Dysgeusia is relatively uncommon. It can have numerous causes. They include viral infections, smoking, gum disease, dental abscess, certain medicines, dry mouth, vitamin deficiency, certain medical conditions, or an allergy to dental materials.","902":"Abnormally large numbers of bacteria are present in the small intestine. Normally the small intestines contracts pushing the contents through the intestine. In bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine this contraction does not occur effectively. This allows the bacteria to multiply. In healthy patients there are different bacteria in the small intestine and large intestine. In this disorder the bacteria in the small intestine are the same kind as those found in the large intestine. The following diseases are associated with this disorder: scleroderma, diabetes, partial small intestine obstruction, diverticula of the small intestine. This abnormal growth of bacteria causes the symptoms.","903":"A stab wound to the finger. These wounds can damage structures deep to the skin such as blood vessels, nerves, or tendons. The object that caused the wound can carry bacteria or foreign material deep into the wound and cause infections. Puncture wounds from animal or human bites are especially prone to infections. ","904":"Caused by one type of the human papilloma virus. This is a wart that grows on the sole of a foot. The area around a plantar wart is a hard, thick patch of skin that may have dark specks. Plantar warts cause pain with walking or weight bearing, and may cause you to feel like you are stepping on a rock.","905":"Caused by one type of the human papilloma virus. This is a wart that grows on the sole of a foot. The area around a plantar wart is a hard, thick patch of skin that may have dark specks. Plantar warts cause pain with walking or weight bearing, and may cause you to feel like you are stepping on a rock.","906":"Erythema nodosum is a raised, red, bumpy rash that usually involves the front of the lower legs. It is often associated with certain infections (streptococcus, coccidiomycosis), drugs (birth control pills, sulfa medications) and diseases (sarcoidosis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis). It can also happen during pregnancy. At times no cause is determined (idiopathic). Most cases resolve within eight weeks. Women are affected more often than men and it occurs most frequently in patients between the ages of 18 and 34.","907":"Benign growth of fat cells. Benign means this is not a cancer. Lipomas grow slowly and do not spread (metastasize). They usually occur on the trunk, neck, back, upper thighs, and arms. They affect both sexes, and all ages, but are more common in patients greater than 60.","908":"A urethral stricture is a narrowing of the urethra, which is the tube that carries urine out of the body from the bladder. This narrowing, which is usually scar tissue, can cause urinary retention (inability to urinate). Scarring can result from inflammation or injury. ","909":"Normally, the two small chambers of the heart (the atria) beat about 60-80 times a minute, in a regular rhythm. In atrial flutter, the two atria beat very rapidly (90-150 times a minute) and usually the large chambers of the heart (ventricles) respond irregularly causing an irregular and rapid heart rate. This disorder at times occurs along with another type of rapid and irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation. The main causes of this disorder include mitral valve disease, high blood pressure, heart attacks, thyroid disease, a blood clot in the lung (pulmonary embolus), stimulants (cocaine, methamphetamines), drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, viral infections and stress from other illnesses.","91":"An incisional hernia occurs because of a weakened area of muscle next to a surgical wound. This weakened area cannot hold in the abdominal contents and it protrudes, or herniates, through the defect. The hernia can contain fat, intestines or other tissue. Typically the hernia protrudes with any activity that increases the pressure in the abdomen such as lifting a heavy object or straining to have a bowel movement. Often, the protrusion will relieve itself or can be gently pushed back in place. If the herniated contents become stuck in the defect it is called an incarcerated hernia. Some incarcerated hernias can cause a blockage of the intestines (bowel obstruction). If an incarcerated hernia is not relieved, the contents of the hernia can swell, lose blood supply and die. This type of hernia is called a strangulated hernia. The most serious strangulated hernias contain intestine and if untreated can lead to a hole in the intestine and a life threatening infection (peritonitis). ","910":"An abnormal beating of the heart that is irregular, too fast or too slow. Arrhythmias occur when the electrical impulses of the heart are abnormal. Conditions that can cause an arrhythmia include: thyroid disease, scar tissue from a previous heart attack, medications, previous heart trauma or congenital abnormalities. However, arrhythmias often occur for no apparent reason.","911":"An impacted tooth is a tooth that gets blocked as it is pushing through the gum into the mouth (erupting). Wisdom teeth (third molars) often are impacted. They may become impacted because the jaw doesn't have enough room for them. An impacted tooth may be painless. However, when an impacted wisdom tooth tries to come in, the flap of gum on top of it can become infected, swollen, and painful (pericoronitis).","912":"A loss of range of motion of the shoulder. The decreased motion is present both when the patient attempts to move the shoulder and when the doctor tries to move the shoulder passively. The decreased motion is caused by inflammation and scarring of the shoulder joint. It can occur after a shoulder injury or after prolonged immobilization of the shoulder.","913":"A missed abortion occurs when a fetus dies at less than 20 weeks and the products of conception remain inside the uterus. Patients may be unaware of the miscarriage or may experience disappearance of pregnancy symptoms such as nausea, fatigue and breast tenderness. A missed abortion is usually confirmed by ultrasound. Treatment may be surgical, medical or expectant (nonintervention, natural expulsion). All therapies are effective and the choice of therapy depends on the circumstance of the missed abortion. Possible contributing factors include infection, smoking, drug and alcohol abuse, serious maternal illness (uncontrolled diabetes) and exposure to toxins. The risk of abortion increases with the age of the mother and with a previous history of miscarriages.","914":"A chronic bacterial infection caused by the bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It mainly affects your lungs. TB is a contagious infectious disease which is spread from person to person through the air. The bacteria are released into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and infects those who inhale the droplets. Most people do not have any symptoms when first infected. The bacteria can lay dormant (called latent TB) in the body and may become reactivated many years later. This reactivation usually occurs when the immune system becomes depressed. Chronic illness, malnutrition, alcoholism, the use of immunosuppressive drugs, AIDS and cancer can all suppress the immune system leading to the spread of the disease. The initial lung infection can then spread to all parts of the body, including kidneys, spine or brain.","915":"Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of cancer of the vulva. It is most often seen in women over 50 years of age. Risk factors include having multiple sexual partners, human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, cervical cancer, and the presence of chronic vaginal and vulvar inflammation.","916":"The appearance of the primary teeth in infants. The appearance of wisdom teeth in preteens and teens. Pericoronitis is an inflammation often with infection and swelling of the gums around the teeth, especially the wisdom teeth.","917":"A cyst below the tailbone (coccyx) usually containing skin or hair cells. These cysts can become infected and develop into an abscess causing swelling and pain. It is believed they occur when a hair cell grows inward. They are more common in men.","918":"A fracture is a broken bone. The fingers are commonly fractured and the treatment needed is dependent on the severity of the fracture. If the broken bone punctures the skin (open fracture) antibiotics will be needed to prevent an infection of the bone (osteomyelitis). If after the fracture the pieces of the bone do not come together properly, they will be put back in place and splinted. Severe fractures may have an associated tendon, nerve or blood vessel injury. Sometimes surgery is needed to realign the bones and to place a screw or wire to stabilize the bones while they heal.","919":"Abuse of cough medicine is becoming more common, especially among teenagers. Information on the internet enables the abusers to know which drugs are most effective for producing a \"high\" and how much to ingest. The main ingredient of abuse is dextromethorphan. This drug is easily available in many over the counter cold medications, including Robitussin DM and Triaminic. \n","92":"Glomerulonephritis is a kidney disease defined by the presence of inflammation in the kidney's filtering system (glomeruli). The inflammation causes protein and red blood cells to flow into the urine while toxins that the kidney normally filters are kept in the body. There are different causes of glomerulonephritis. In some instances, it can be caused by infections such as strep throat or autoimmune disorders such as lupus. In other cases, no cause can be identified. ","920":"Friedrich's ataxia is an inherited disorder that causes deterioration of nerve cells over time. In addition to nerve cells, many people also experience problems with the heart, bones and the pancreas. The disorder is caused by extra repetitions of a small segment of the genetic code on the 9th chromosome. Most people with the disease experience symptoms in childhood but cases have been reported in infants and middle-aged adults. Symptoms begin with difficulty walking and progress to trouble talking and shaking. In the end, the majority of patients are unable to walk and develop heart failure.","921":"Body lice are tiny parasitic insects (Pediculus humanus corporis) that live on the body. They feed on the blood of the infected person and are easily spread by close contact with other people. The infection can also be contracted through contact with infected furniture or by sharing brushes or bedding. There are several types of lice including head, body and pubic lice.","922":"An abnormal and malignant growth of cells in the tonsil. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common. It is most often seen in those 50 or older and is more common in smokers and heavy alcohol drinkers. It can also be associated with oral human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. ","923":"The inability to empty the bladder. Urinary retention can be caused by an obstruction in the urinary tract or by nerve problems that interfere with signals between the brain and the bladder. There are many causes, and the disorder can occur over a long period of time (chronic) or abruptly (acute). People with chronic retention are able to urinate but the stream is decreased and many times they cannot empty the bladder completely. Acute retention is an emergency since the kidneys can fail if the urine is not able to drain. In men, an enlarged prostate is the most common reason for urinary retention.","924":"Burned palate occurs when hot foods or liquids burn the roof (palate) of the mouth. These burns usually are minor and heal within a few days.","925":"A rare disease that causes inflammation in the medium and large arteries of the body. The disease is more common in females and in people of Asian descent. Over time the inflammation results in scarring and damage to the blood vessels. The aorta is the main blood vessel of the body and Takayasu's arteritis targets that vessel and its branches. The damage to the blood vessels results in decreased blood flow to the attached organs (heart, kidney, brain) and this can cause serious problems like strokes and heart attacks. ","926":"A bacterial infection of the gastrointestinal tract caused by the bacteria Salmonella typhi. The disease rarely occurs in developed countries. It is most commonly seen in countries with poor sanitary conditions and contaminated water supplies. Vaccines and being careful with food and water consumption while traveling can help prevent the infection. There are three stages to the infection. Each stage gets progressively more serious.","927":"A muscle spasm also known as a Charley horse typically occurs after vigorous exercise. The affected muscle contracts involuntarily and will not relax. It can occur in any muscle of the body but typically involves the legs, arms and neck. Other causes include dehydration and changes in a person's body chemistry with abnormal levels of minerals. Low blood levels of potassium, magnesium and calcium are the most frequent causes of a Charley horse, but sometimes no cause can be found. More rarely muscle spasms can occur if the nerve supplying the muscle is injured or irritated.","928":"A weakening in the abdominal wall that allows abdominal contents to protrude through the defect. If the intestines poke through the defect they can become blocked. At times the intestine can lose blood supply and die leading to a life threatening problem (strangulated hernia). Ventral hernias can occur after surgery and are more likely to develop if the patient is obese. Ventral hernias involving the belly button are called umbilical hernias.","929":"An abnormal pattern of reproductive hormones in women results in irregular menstruation and the appearance of multiple cysts in the ovaries. This is usually diagnosed in young women who have absent or irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity. The exact cause of polycystic ovary syndrome is unknown. Each cyst in an ovary occurs because an egg does not release easily from the ovary. Some women with PCOS are infertile (treatments are available). The hormone pattern of this condition is closely related to insulin resistance, which is the cause of type 2 diabetes. (It is common to have both polycystic ovaries and diabetes).","93":"A fungal infection that affects the feet, most commonly between the toes. It is the most common fungal infection and is caused by the same fungi that cause ringworm. Keeping the skin clean and dry is the best way to prevent athlete's foot. The disorder is contagious and can be acquired by coming into contact with infected floors, shoes, or other surfaces. Rarely athlete's foot can become secondarily infected with bacteria.","930":"A scar is a natural part of the wound healing process. Fibrous tissue replaces normal skin at the site of a skin injury. At times, scars can overgrow, resulting in keloid formation or a hypertrophic scar. Scars may occur after surgery, injury or a burn.","931":"A pocket of fluid that forms a lump behind the knee. It is also called a popliteal cyst. The fluid can extend down the leg and cause leg swelling and be mistaken for a deep vein blood clot of the leg.","932":"Lip biting is a common habit. Some people bite their lip often enough to cause injury. Lip-biting syndrome is a chronic (long-term) habit that can lead to dry, peeling and sore lips.","933":"A progressive disease of the bile ducts of the liver and the ducts that drain the gallbladder. It is characterized by inflammation and scarring of the ducts. The bile ducts develop narrowed areas (strictures) causing blocked bile flow. Cirrhosis (liver scarring) and liver failure occur. Bile duct cancer may occur in up to 15% of patients. The disorder is frequently associated with inflammatory bowel disease.","934":"Caused when a tick from a family of ticks known as Ixodidae or hard ticks bites a human. The tick passes the bacteria Rickettsia rickettsii into the blood stream of the infected person causing an illness with a fever and a rash. The disease can be fatal 20%-30% of the time if untreated. Despite its name the disease is found throughout the United States. Treatment reduces the mortality rate from 20% to 5% and should be started as soon as possible. The disease is most common between April and September and most commonly affects the age groups of 5-9 and 60-69.","935":"Cervical dysplasia is an abnormal change to the cells on the cervix (lower uterus) found usually with a routine Pap smear procedure. It is strongly associated with human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, which is spread through sexual contact. Cervical dysplasia usually causes no symptoms. If left untreated, it can lead to cervical cancer.","936":"A blood pressure that is too low to support bodily functions. It is often defined as a systolic pressure reading (the top number) that is less than 90 mmHg. However, some healthy people have blood pressures in this range and higher pressures may be too low for people used to much higher pressures. If insufficient blood is delivered to the cells of the body there will not be enough oxygen and other nutrients and the organs will begin to fail. Low blood pressure has many causes including: severe infection, blood loss, traumatic injuries to the chest or abdomen, heart attack, severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), heart arrhythmia, heart failure, medications, overdoses, and severe spinal cord injury.","937":"Salivary gland stones are deposits of calcium phosphate and carbon in the salivary glands. Sialoliths affect men twice as often as women. Salivary stones most often affect the submandibular glands. The cause of salivary gland stones is unknown. Research suggests that inflammation, irritation, and some medicines increase the risk of developing them.","938":"Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is the excessive growth and activity of cells lining medium sized blood vessels causing the area to become narrow. The most common arteries affected are the arteries in the kidneys. The arteries of the brain, limbs, lungs and heart can also be affected. The condition is most common in women of child-bearing age. ","939":"A collection of cancerous cells in the larynx. In advanced cases, it can obstruct the airway, prevent swallowing, or damage vital blood vessels in the neck. The larynx or voice box contains the vocal cords and is located between the pharynx (mouth and throat) and the trachea (windpipe). The following conditions increase the risk of this cancer: age greater than 55, smoking and drinking excessive alcohol.","94":"Retinal vein occlusion is the blockage of blood flow through the vein that drains the light-sensitive layer of the eye called the retina. Blood backs up and causes bleeding and damage to the retina. Varying degrees of visual loss can occur depending on the severity of the blockage. Retinal vein occlusion happens most often in people over age 50. Men are at higher risk than women. The risk of retinal vein occlusion increases with certain disease processes such as high blood pressure, diabetes, glaucoma, leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma.","940":"A common injury from a forceful twisting, pivot, or sudden stop of the knee causing a tear or stretch of the ACL ligament in the knee, in which no bones are broken. The knee joint has four major ligaments that may be injured called the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), and lateral collateral ligament (LCL). A knee sprain with an ACL injury can also result in injury to other ligaments. Sprains are commonly graded in a severity range from Grade I (mild) to Grade III (severe). ACL injuries tend to be severe, often involving a complete tear of the ligament. Severe injuries may need immobilization and\/or surgical reconstruction of the ligament. ","941":"A disorder of the nervous system that causes a person to make repeated and uncontrolled movements and sounds called tics. People with this condition may twitch, shrug their shoulders, blink, jerk their head, utter grunts or make strange sounds, or even to yell out curse words. Many children with Tourette's will outgrow the disorder. The symptoms appear in childhood and in about half disappear in the late teen years. ","942":"A build-up of pus that forms a lump (swelling) in one of the Bartholin's glands. These glands are located in the labia on each side of the vaginal opening. This disorder occurs when one of the Bartholin glands become clogged. ","943":"An abscess (collection of pus caused by a bacterial infection) that is larger than a boil. It may be as small as a peanut or as large as a golf ball. The infection arises from hair follicles. The most common kind of bacteria causing an abscess is Staphylococcus aureus. A more dangerous, antibiotic-resistant form of Staphylococcus aureus, called MRSA (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus), is becoming more common. Abscesses can occur anywhere on the body but are more commonly found on the back, neck or in skin areas that are shaved frequently. The infection is more common in people with diabetes or other disorders that depress the immune system.","944":"An advanced form of syphilis. Syphilis is caused by the bacteria Treponema pallidum. Quaternary syphilis is syphilis in late stages that has involved the heart or brain (neurosyphilis). Neurosyphilis is a progressive and advanced brain infection (encephalitis). Patients may have dementia, personality changes, unsteady gait, visual problems, stroke symptoms and seizures. ","945":"Tropical sprue is a disease of the small intestines that results in the inability to absorb certain nutrients such as vitamin B12 and folic acid. Tropical sprue occurs in people who live in a specific geographic region from approximately thirty degrees south of the equator to thirty degrees north of the equator. The exact cause of the disease is unknown, but it is likely secondary to an infection. Traveler's going to these regions can also be affected but usually only after a stay of a month or longer.","946":"Pooling of venous blood in the legs that causes swelling, varicose veins and when severe ulcers. When calf muscles contract, they squeeze blood through the leg veins back toward the heart. Normally these leg veins contain valves that allow the blood to travel upward but prevent backward flow. In chronic venous stasis, the veins do not work properly, allowing the blood to pool in the legs. This causes the symptoms. The following conditions are associated with this disorder: blood clots (deep venous thrombosis \/ DVT), obesity, jobs or hobbies that require frequent and prolonged standing, being female, smoking, family history of chronic venous insufficiency, advanced age, previous broken leg or other severe trauma, and pregnancy.","947":"A contagious viral infection that principally involves the upper-respiratory passages, the nose, throat, sinuses, ears, eustachian tubes, trachea, larynx, and bronchial tubes. Since they are caused by a virus, common colds are not responsive to antibiotics. Sometimes it is difficult to tell the difference between a cold and the flu based on symptoms alone. Special tests must be done within the first few days of illness to confirm a diagnosis of the flu. Colds are usually milder than the flu with lower fevers and milder body aches. Colds generally do not result in serious health problems such as pneumonia, bacterial infections, or hospitalizations. For more information on the flu and how it differs from a cold: http:\/\/www.flu.gov.","948":"The conjunctiva is a thin, transparent membrane that covers the white part of the eye and eyelids. Conjunctivitis can occur from infection, inflammation or allergies. Infections can result from virus or bacteria although viral causes are more common. Infectious conjunctivitis occurs more commonly in children and can be highly contagious. It is mainly spread through direct contact with infected tears, eye discharge, respiratory droplets, or contaminated objects.","949":"A collection of infectious fluid (purulent) in the subcutaneous tissue of the breast. The abscess is painful and can have a surrounding infection of the skin (cellulitis). There may be painful, swollen lumps in the armpit adjacent to the breast involved. The bacteria most commonly causing the infection is Staphylococcus aureus. ","95":"A collection of pus and infectious material in the spine. The most common causes are spread of an infection in the blood, spread of infection from an adjacent infection or from an injury causing an inoculation of bacteria into the spine. This disorder can also occur after medical procedures or surgery involving the spine.","950":"A wrist sprain is a common injury. A sprain occurs when the ligaments (band of tissue that connects two bones) of the wrist are stretched or torn. Sprains are commonly graded by severity and range from Grade I (mild) to Grade III (severe). Most mild sprains heal on their own with just rest. Severe injuries may need immobilization and\/or surgical repair.","951":"An abnormal presence of bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi in the body causing disease. Common sites of infection include the ear, nose, throat, skin and bladder. But any part of the body may develop an infection. ","952":"Inflammation of the appendix. The appendix is a small pouch extending from the cecum, the first part of the large intestine. In appendicitis the opening of the pouch becomes blocked with fecal material (appendicolith) causing swelling of the appendix and allowing bacteria to grow in this area. The appendix has no function and can rupture if the appendicitis is untreated.\r\n","953":"Ethanol is commonly called alcohol and it is the chemical in alcoholic drinks that causes the behavioral and physical changes experienced when it is ingested. Ethanol is the most commonly used drug in the U.S. This substance affects people differently and can be very addictive. Patients can die from drinking too much by depressing their breathing. They are then at risk of aspirating mouth contents because they cannot protect their airway. Some patients experience significant withdrawal when they stop drinking including tremors, seizures, hallucinations and even death.  ","954":"A malignant cancer of the soft tissue including the muscles, nerves, fat, blood vessels, tendons and covering of the joints (synovium). These cancers are rare but very dangerous and if not detected and treated early can result in death. One particular type is called Kaposi sarcoma and is seen in patients with weakened immune systems such as AIDS. While this disorder can occur at any age it is generally seen in older patients. The risk of this cancer increases with exposure to the chemicals vinyl chloride and dioxin. Radiation exposure for the treatment of other cancers also increases one risk of the disease. These cancers can occur anywhere but are most commonly found in the abdomen, arms and legs. ","955":"Noncancerous masses of muscular and fibrous tissue overgrowth of the uterus. They are common and usually appear in women older than age 20. The exact cause of fibroids is unknown. The symptoms and complications of this disorder are determined by the size of the growths, how quickly they grow and their location. They may cause pain, bleeding or affect fertility.","956":"An infectious viral disease caused by the Epstein Barr virus. This disease is most common in adolescents and young adults and is characterized by fever, sore throat and fatigue. Also known as \"Mono\". Some patients will also have an enlargement of their spleen. This splenic enlargement puts them at risk of life threatening splenic rupture with even minimal abdominal trauma. Once patients get this infection they generally carry lifelong immunity.","957":"People with sensitive teeth feel discomfort when the teeth are touched or when they drink or eat certain things. Dentinal sensitivity occurs when the outer protective layer of a tooth wears away. Causes include hard brushing, poor oral hygiene, untreated cavities and exposed tooth roots. Pulpal sensitivity affects the center layer of the tooth. Causes include decay or infection, a recent filling, clenching or grinding of teeth, or a cracked or broken tooth. Gums tend to recede as people get older. This may expose sensitive root surfaces.","958":"High levels of a form of hemoglobin called methemoglobin are found in the blood. This may be caused either by an inherited condition or by exposure to a medication or drug. Hemoglobin carries the oxygen in the blood and is found within the red blood cells. Because methemoglobin is not able to carry oxygen normally, it causes a bluish discoloration to the skin. The most common drugs to cause the disorder are: benzocaine, lidocaine, dapsone, chloroquine, nitrates, and nitrites. Nitrates are sometimes inhaled and used as a drug of abuse called \"poppers\". The disease can be very serious leading to very low blood pressure, seizures and death.","959":"Twisting of the bowel causing a blockage of food material and usually decreased blood flow to the affected intestine. The intestine can die causing peritonitis and death. The volvulus may occur in children due to a congenital abnormality while in adults it is associated with overuse of laxatives and psychiatric disease (or its treatment). Often, no cause can be identified.","96":"Refers to pain in the shin secondary to overuse of the leg. The pain can arise from inflammation of the bone (tibia), the muscle or connective tissue. The most common causes are ill-fitting shoes, over training, and running on hard surfaces. Patients who have fallen arches (flat feet) are also more likely to suffer from this problem. Prevention is the best medicine with shin splints. To reduce the risk of this disorder: 1) Do not increase running distances by more than 10% per week; 2) Avoid running on hard surfaces; 3) Wear shoes that fit well and are made for running long distances; and 4) Stretch the muscles of the lower leg and ankle.","960":"An infection of the intestine, liver, or other tissues by the organism Entamoeba histolytica. The infection is acquired by ingesting food or water contaminated by infected feces.","961":"An infection of the hair follicles. The most common germ that causes the  disorder is Staphylococcus aureus. The disorder can occur from irritation to the skin such as shaving (Barber's itch) or from exposure to bacteria in a hot tub (hot tub folliculitis). Most infections are minor and some will resolve on their own without specific treatment. At times the infection can spread and involve the surrounding skin (cellulitis). Typically the infection causes pain and itching and small white pimples are seen at the base of the hair follicle. The disease is more common in patients with a weakened immune system. Other causes include: obesity, diabetes, acne, or topical corticosteroid use.","962":"A viral illness that leads to a rash on the cheeks, arms, and legs. The disorder is also called erythema infectiosum and produces a characteristic \"slapped cheek\" rash. It is most often seen in children 5-14 years of age and is spread by sneezing and coughing of the virus through the air. The name of the virus that causes the disease is human parvovirus B19.","963":"An elevated bilirubin in the blood commonly seen in newborns born before the 38th week of pregnancy. The liver of immature babies generally cannot break down the bilirubin causing the elevated levels. Bilirubin is a breakdown product of red blood cells. Most babies do not need treatment. If the level is very high brain damage can occur.","964":"A nervous system disease that attacks nerve cells called motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These neurons enable people to control their voluntary muscles. The disease is most common after 40 years of age, is progressive and is more common in males. There is no known treatment and therapy is aimed at reducing the symptoms and prolonging survival. Eventually patients are no longer able to breathe and suffer respiratory failure and death. The cause of ALS is not known.","965":"Benzodiazepines (Valium, Xanax, Ativan) are tranquilizers and are commonly prescribed for anxiety, panic attacks, and as muscle relaxants. An overdose can cause coma, severe respiratory depression and death. The symptoms of intoxication are accentuated by the co-ingestion of narcotic pain medications and\/or alcohol. Toxicity can also be considered an overdose.","966":"Low potassium level in the blood. Causes of hypokalemia include: 1) medications, especially diuretics; 2) kidney disease; 3) diarrhea; 4) vomiting; 5) eating disorders (bulimia). The body requires potassium for muscle contraction (including the heart), and for other important bodily functions. ","967":"Lymphadenitis is the inflammation of a lymph node. Lymphadenitis may affect a single node or a group of nodes. Lymph nodes are small oval structures that filter and remove foreign substances such as bacteria. Lymphadenitis can occur for a variety of reasons including infection and cancer.","968":"Blood that collects beneath the covering of the white part of the eye (sclera). This covering is called the conjunctiva and the disorder occurs when a small blood vessel in the conjunctiva breaks and bleeds. It can occur with or without injury, and can occur after a forceful sneeze or cough. Usually the only symptom is a painless red eye.  The disorder occurs commonly, but more often in people who are taking blood thinners or who have a condition that makes it harder for their blood to clot.","969":"An abnormal heart rhythm is called an arrhythmia (also called dysrhythmia). A normal heart rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute. Arrhythmias can occur with a normal heart rate, slow rates (bradycardia - less than 60 beats per minute), or rapid rates (tachycardia - faster than 100 beats per minute). This disorder occurs when the normal electrical impulses that control the rate and frequency of the heart beats are disrupted. There are many possible causes, such as heart attacks, blood chemistry abnormalities (i.e. high potassium), congestive heart failure, medication reactions, viral infections of the heart (myocarditis), weakened heart muscle (cardiomyopathy), thickened heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), thyroid disease, congenital heart disorders, and drug abuse.","97":"Caused by a blocked gland that becomes inflamed and infected by bacteria. Styes can develop on the eyelid margins (external hordeolum) or under the eyelid (internal hordeolum). Chronic styes can become chalazions.","970":"Thinning and inflammation of the vaginal walls. The disorder occurs around or after menopause and is caused by declining levels of estrogen. Any other disorder that corresponds with lower levels of estrogen can also lead to the disorder including surgical removal of the ovaries, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy for breast cancer.","971":"A brain disease that results in tremor (shaking of the hand), stiff muscles, and difficulty initiating movement. The problem results from deterioration of a part of the brain called the \"substantia nigra,\" where the brain hormone dopamine is made. Besides movement problems many patients experience depression, blandness of facial expression, and memory loss. ","972":"After suddenly stopping alcohol consumption patients can have a wide range of symptoms ranging from tremors and sweating, to seizures, hallucinations, and death. This disorder is more likely to occur in patients who have been drinking daily for weeks to months. The symptoms can begin a few hours to a day after drinking has stopped, and can last for as long as 1-2 weeks. ","973":"Some of the most common causes of leg swelling include: trauma, skin or joint inflammation, infection, an allergic reaction, a blood clot (superficial or deep vein thrombosis or thrombophlebitis), heart or liver failure, venous insufficiency(\"bad veins\"), and kidney disease. ","974":"Paget disease is an abnormality of the growth cycle of bone. Normally, bone breaks down and is rebuilt daily. In Paget disease, the bone cells break down more rapidly and regrow more rapidly than normal. This results in bone that is rebuilt in a more random fashion. As a result, individuals can experience pain, skull enlargement and bowing of the legs. Paget disease is often without symptoms and is the second most common bone disorder in people over age fifty.","975":"This disorder destroys the central vision of the eye. It is the leading cause of permanent vision loss in patients over 60. The macula is a part of the retina that enables one to see fine detail. Over time the cells of the macula die causing a gradual and painless loss of eyesight. The cause of macular degeneration is unknown but the following conditions increase the risk of developing this disorder: family history of the problem, increasing age, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, being white, and being female.","976":"Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a type of breast cancer that starts inside the milk ducts and doesn't invade the surrounding tissue.  DCIS is usually asymptomatic and is often found early on a screening mammogram.  DCIS is the most common type of non-invasive breast cancer and represents 20% of all newly diagnosed breast cancers.  Risk factors include a family history of breast cancer, increased breast density, obesity and first pregnancy after age 30. It is also associated with the BRCA 1 and 2 breast cancer genes.","977":"Dystonia is the uncontrollable contraction of your muscles. It may affect a single area of the body (focal), multiple areas (segmental) or your entire body (generalized). Some forms of dystonia are inherited while others are associated with certain diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Wilson's disease, Huntington's disease, brain tumors, lead and carbon monoxide poisoning, strokes and traumatic brain injury. In many other cases, no obvious cause is found.","978":"Anemia caused by a low vitamin B12 level secondary to a decreased absorption of B12 from the intestines. Normally, a protein called intrinsic factor binds to B12 in the gut. This enables B12 to be absorbed in the small intestine. Intrinsic factor is made in the lining of the stomach. Low levels of intrinsic factor can result from a disease of the stomach lining, from the body attacking the cells in the stomach that make intrinsic factor and from the body making antibodies against the intrinsic factor. There is also a congenital form that can affect children, but most cases develop gradually and occur after age 30. People with certain conditions are at greater risk of developing pernicious anemia including: Addison's disease, thyroid disease, low parathyroid hormone, pituitary problems, myasthenia gravis, Type 1 diabetes, and vitiligo. In addition to anemia low levels of B12 causes problems with the nerves in the spinal cord causing neurologic problems.","979":"A break in one or more of the bones in the skull caused by a head injury. The injury usually results from blunt or penetrating trauma (fall, motor vehicle accident). The amount of force required to break the bone frequently damages the underlying brain. The broken bone fragments can also damage the underlying brain or lacerate blood vessels causing bleeding in the brain. Fractures of the bone in the base of the skull can result in leaking of cerebrospinal fluid.","98":"Bacteria that live in brackish saltwater of the U.S. and Canada. The infection causes vomiting and diarrhea in humans. The symptoms began 24 hours after eating infected raw or undercooked shellfish, particularly oysters. Most patients are well after 3 days without treatment. Those with impaired immune systems can have more serious infections. Rarely open wounds exposed to contaminated water can become infected with these bacteria.","980":"The lower leg is the area of the body between the knee and the ankle. The lower leg is made up of two bones called the tibia and fibula. The tibia is a very strong bone located along the inside of the lower leg while the fibula is a much thinner bone and is on the outside. Fractures of the lower leg are the most common long bone fractures. Treatment depends on the location, severity of the injury and age of the patient. The fracture can damage adjacent nerves and blood vessels.","981":"A blood clot in a pulmonary artery (the circulation of the lung.) Blood clots typically start in a vein in the leg. Some or all of the clot can break off, pass through the heart, and then float into a pulmonary artery. These arteries get progressively smaller and the clot (embolus) eventually lodges into one of these arteries preventing blood flow. These clots make circulation through the lungs inefficient so the lungs do not work as well. When the clot is very large (called a saddle embolus) it can result in rapid death. The following increase the risk of blood clots: recent surgery, a history of previous blood clots, cancer, being bedbound, sitting for prolonged periods of time, birth control pills, surgery and pregnancy.","982":"A blockage of blood flow to an area of the kidney causing death of tissue in a small section of a kidney. Usually, a renal infarct happens when a blood clot (embolus) that has formed in the heart or on a heart valve floats through the circulation into the kidney. This blood clot then blocks flow to part of the kidney. The disorder is most commonly seen in patients with an infected heart valve (endocarditis) or heart failure. Less often it is associated with: inflammation of an artery (vasculitis), a disorder that causes blood to clot easily (hypercoagulable state), trauma, cancer, or after surgery. The most common symptoms are back pain and bloody urine (hematuria).","983":"Tetanus commonly known as \"lockjaw\" is a very serious illness caused by the Clostridium tetani (C. tetani). The C. tetani bacteria live in soil, saliva, dust, and manure. These bacteria enter the body through a contaminated deep cut or from a puncture wound. They produce a neurotoxin which causes the body to develop severe painful muscle spasms. Tetanus is a medical emergency. Without immediate treatment tetanus can result in death.","984":"An abnormal connection between the rectum and vagina. This condition can occur with the following conditions: having a baby, surgery, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn\u2019s disease), and cancer. The primary symptom is the passing of stool or gas from the vagina. ","985":"Cheilosis is a painful inflammation and cracking of the corners of the mouth. It also is called cheilitis. It sometimes occurs on only one side of the mouth, but usually involves both sides. Cheilosis is caused by a yeast (Candida) infection. Cheilosis occurs most often in people who have ill-fitting dentures or a habit of licking or rubbing the corners of their mouth. People with health disorders such as anemia, diabetes and immune deficiencies are also more likely to develop it.","986":"Ant bites can cause local irritation, itching, and allergic reactions.","987":"A hole (perforation) in the nasal septum, the tissue that separates the nostrils. Common causes include: previous nasal surgery, previous nasal fracture, frequent use of nasal steroid sprays, and other causes. ","988":"Results from decreased blood supply to the intestines. The arteries typically become blocked with atherosclerosis, but can also be obstructed from a blood clot that travels to the artery from another location (an embolus) or inflammation of an intestinal artery (vasculitis). Intestinal ischemia can also develop due to low blood pressure, from a twisting of the bowel (volvulus), or from an internal hernia. If the ischemia continues, the intestines can die (infarction) and result in peritonitis and death.","989":"Occurs when there is not enough circulating insulin. This lack of insulin causes elevated glucose levels in the blood and forces the body to breakdown body fats for energy. This results in a buildup of ketones. The increased ketone level raises the acidity of the blood; and when severe it can result in coma and death. This disorder is also called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and is most often associated with diabetes type 1. The most common causes of DKA are not taking the correct amounts of insulin and a secondary stress to the body such as an infection, surgery or trauma.","99":"The body's reaction to heat, radiation, electricity or chemicals which causes damage to the skin and sometimes organs. Electrical and radiation burns may involve tissues underneath the skin, such as the intestinal tract, nerves, spinal cord, heart and brain. Burns caused by contact involve primarily the skin. They can be superficial or destroy all layers of the skin. Any burn that causes singed nasal hairs or the coughing up of darkish sputum requires immediate medical treatment since the respiratory tract may be injured. Burns involving larger areas of the body can result in a great deal of fluid being lost and result in life threatening dehydration. Potential injury is greatest with infants, young children and the elderly. ","990":"A common disorder of the female breast, with formation of benign lumps that can cause discomfort and pain. It can affect females from puberty to 50 and occurs in about 20% of women. It needs to be differentiated from breast masses that may be cancerous.","991":"Painful menstruation resulting from another diagnosis in the pelvis. Disorders that cause secondary dysmenorrhea include: endometriosis, salpingitis, PID (pelvic inflammatory disease), postsurgical adhesions, ovarian cyst and an IUD. The pain begins a few days before menstruation and lasts several days after the onset of flow. ","992":"Excessive loss of hair from the scalp. The medical term is alopecia. The disorder can have many causes including stress from surgery or illness, hormonal changes (thyroid hormone, estrogen, androgen), medication side effects, fungal infections, and diseases such as autoimmune diseases or diabetes. Trauma to the hair follicles (traction alopecia) from certain hair styles can cause localized loss of hair as can chemicals applied to the scalp from hair treatments and colorings. Hair loss can be a normal part of aging and is called common baldness (androgenic alopecia). This type of hair loss is hereditary and the earlier it begins the worse the baldness becomes with time.","993":"A laceration that involves the nail and the nail bed underneath.","994":"A pregnancy of two or more fetuses. Multiple fetuses can be the same (identical) or different (fraternal). The following increase the chance of multiple pregnancies: heredity (a family history of multiple pregnancy increases the chances of having twins); older age (women over 30 have a greater chance of multiple conception); high parity (having one or more previous pregnancies, especially a multiple pregnancy); race (African-American women are more likely to have twins); taking fertility drugs, and receiving fertility treatments to become pregnant.","995":"An injury to the joint in which the ends of your bones are forced from their normal positions. The injury temporarily deforms and immobilizes the joint and may result in sudden and severe pain. Associated nerve or vascular injury can occur. Often, nearby ligaments are stretched or torn during the injury.","996":"A bursa is a sac of clear fluid and part of a joint that allows the tendons to move more easily over and between the bones of the joint. Many joints of the body have bursas. Bursitis is inflammation of the joint. It can occur without any identifiable reason. Other causes include trauma, arthritis, and infection. The shoulders, knees, hips, and elbows are the most commonly affected joints. ","997":"A cancer of lymph tissue (lymph nodes, spleen and thymus). The abnormally growing cells can leave the lymphatic system and involve the other organs of the body. The cancer can impair one's ability to fight infection. This disorder is less common than non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.","998":"Actinic keratoses are tiny rough bumps that appear on the skin as a result of sun damage to exposed skin areas such as the face, ears, neck, scalp, chest and arms. They may be pink, red, yellow or brown in color. Actinic keratoses are associated with an increased risk of skin cancer. Up to 10% of actinic keratoses will transform into squamous cell carcinomas. ","999":"Tear of the ligament. Ligaments are strong, fibrous bands of tissue that hold bones together near joints. This provides stability. Trauma is the most common cause of a torn ligament. Ligament tears can make it difficult or impossible to use the joint."},"disease":{"0":"Sinus infection (sinusitis)","1":"Cubital tunnel syndrome (nerve compression in the elbow)","10":"Thoracic outlet
